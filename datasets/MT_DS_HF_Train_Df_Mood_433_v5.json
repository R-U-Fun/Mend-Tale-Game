I have tried using normal timers but i usually end up and just pause it saying ill come back later and never do it but with this i can set a timer and it keeps me off my other phone apps and keeps me seated since i cant really pause the timer. And its also really nice to see my progress throughout the week for practicing with all the trees that ive planted. Overall really nice app, i highly recommend it!!!",

One master list of everything from all other lists is a crucial feature and very much needed! For now I am marking all tasks as important so they are all captured there as a workaround. P.s. I am loving the tags feature, and the audio when you check a task off. So fulfilling!",

I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.",

I just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use (it is a premium feature, but it would be nice if there is a character limit, as a compromise). The app supports syncing with calendars. But imo, a todoist calendar option will be better - no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity.

Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!",

The idea of \"streaks\" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way.  When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face.  What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit.  I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up.  The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better.",

Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.",

This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: \"A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.\"",

For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like \"repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date.\" --- Now, having a day of the week and also \"from completion date\" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the \"Thursday\" and the \"from completion date.\" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work.",

When I check the button that tells you, it's just a random app that I hadn't opened that day. Its happened several times and it makes me really sad so please fix this. 2. I can't get the app to let me access any other apps. Sometimes I will use it for homework so I don't get side tracked but I can't open a calculator without sacrificing the life of my tree. I wish you could select apps that would be okay to stay on. Please fix these two things and I will give you 5 stars for sure!!!",

Note I did not use this feature, but it's a pro because there's an option to i.e. I do not know how well it works or not Cons: - The resizing / reactiveness of the webapp isn't ideal ATM; on a 1920x1280 screen the web app occupies the middle third - Comments are a premium only feature, compared to being in the freebie section of Wunderlist - Ditto on labels being a premium only feature (hashtag support was available in Wunderlist) TL;DR: 4/5 Pretty awesome to-do app. I missing some of the features I had from a competitor but not deal-breakers",

So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",

It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete.

The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.",

I wish they have 2 things fixed/updated to meet Wunderlist feel: 1) Importance mark (the renown star) should be entered while typing a task. Importance mark should also put automatically the task on top of the list. 2) 'Show completed tasks' must be more 'handy', with a button, symbol or shortcut. Not as part of the menu (top right). 5 stars. Hope above of a help.",
