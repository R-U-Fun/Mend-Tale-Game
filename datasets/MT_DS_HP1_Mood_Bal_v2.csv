Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone,0,Neutral
CHAPTER ONE,0,Neutral
THE BOY WHO LIVED,0,Neutral
Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much,1,Happy
They were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just did not hold with such nonsense,0,Neutral
Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made drills,0,Neutral
He was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache,0,Neutral
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors,5,Anger
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere,2,Love
The Dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it,6,Fear
They did not think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters,6,Fear
Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursleys sister but they had not met for several years; in fact Mrs Dursley pretended she did not have a sister because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be,5,Anger
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street,6,Fear
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him,4,Sad
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they did not want Dudley mixing with a child like that,6,Fear
When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull gray Tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country,3,Excite
Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair,1,Happy
None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window,4,Sad
At half past eight Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls,2,Love
Little tyke chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house,1,Happy
He got into his car and backed out of number fours drive,0,Neutral
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map,3,Excite
For a second Mr Dursley did not realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again,6,Fear
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive but there was not a map in sight,3,Excite
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light,1,Happy
Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat,5,Anger
It stared back,5,Anger
As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror,0,Neutral
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive no looking at the sign; cats could not read maps or signs,5,Anger
Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind,4,Sad
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day,3,Excite
But on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else,1,Happy
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he could not help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about,5,Anger
People in cloaks,0,Neutral
Mr Dursley could not bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people He supposed this was some stupid new fashion,5,Anger
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by,5,Anger
Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them were not young at all; why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald-green cloak The nerve of him But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something,5,Anger
yes that would be it,0,Neutral
The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills,1,Happy
Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor,0,Neutral
If he had not he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning,4,Sad
He did not see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead,3,Excite
Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime,0,Neutral
He yelled at five different people,5,Anger
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more,5,Anger
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he had stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery,1,Happy
Hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers,1,Happy
He eyed them angrily as he passed,5,Anger
He did not know why but they made him uneasy,6,Fear
This bunch were whispering excitedly too and he could not see a single collecting tin,3,Excite
It was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying,1,Happy
The Potters That is right That is what I heard yes their son Harry,3,Excite
Mr Dursley stopped dead,6,Fear
Fear flooded him,6,Fear
He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it,6,Fear
He dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind,5,Anger
He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid,5,Anger
Potter was not such an unusual name,0,Neutral
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry,0,Neutral
Come to think of it he was not even sure his nephew was called Harry,5,Anger
It might have been Harvey,0,Neutral
Or Harold,0,Neutral
There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister,4,Sad
He did not blame her if he had had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks,4,Sad
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door,4,Sad
Sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell,5,Anger
It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak,1,Happy
He did not seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground,3,Excite
On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare do not be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today Rejoice for You-Know-Who has gone at last Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day,3,Excite
And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off,2,Love
Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot,6,Fear
He had been hugged by a complete stranger,2,Love
He also thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that was,1,Happy
He was rattled,6,Fear
He hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he did not approve of imagination,4,Sad
As he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it did not improve his mood was the tabby cat he had spotted that morning,3,Excite
It was now sitting on his garden wall,0,Neutral
He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes,1,Happy
Shoo said Mr Dursley loudly,5,Anger
The cat did not move,0,Neutral
It just gave him a stern look,5,Anger
Was this normal cat behavior? Mr Dursley wondered,3,Excite
Trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house,1,Happy
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife,5,Anger
Mrs Dursley had had a nice normal day,1,Happy
She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Doors problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word Wont,1,Happy
When Dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news And finally bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today,3,Excite
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise,3,Excite
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern,6,Fear
The newscaster allowed himself a grin,1,Happy
Most mysterious,6,Fear
Going to be any more showers of owls tonight Jim?,5,Anger
Well Ted said the weatherman I do not know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today,4,Sad
Viewers as far apart as Kent Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early its not until next week folks But I can promise a wet night tonight,1,Happy
Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair,6,Fear
Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper a whisper about the Potters,6,Fear
Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea,1,Happy
Hed have to say something to her,6,Fear
He cleared his throat nervously,6,Fear
Er Petunia dear you have not heard from your sister lately have you?,2,Love
As he had expected Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry,5,Anger
After all they normally pretended she did not have a sister,4,Sad
No she said sharply,5,Anger
Why?,0,Neutral
Owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today,3,Excite
So? snapped Mrs Dursley,5,Anger
Well I just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd,5,Anger
Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips,5,Anger
Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he had heard the name Potter,6,Fear
Instead he said as casually as he could Their son he had be about Dudleys age now would not he?,2,Love
Whats his name again? Howard is not it?,3,Excite
Harry,0,Neutral
Nasty common name if you ask me,5,Anger
Oh yes said Mr Dursley his heart sinking horribly,6,Fear
He did not say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed,2,Love
While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden,3,Excite
The cat was still there,0,Neutral
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something,3,Excite
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he did not think he could bear it,3,Excite
The Dursleys got into bed,2,Love
Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind,4,Sad
His last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley,1,Happy
The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind,1,Happy
He could not see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it could not affect them,1,Happy
Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness,4,Sad
It was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive,0,Neutral
It did not so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead,3,Excite
In fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all,4,Sad
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought he had just popped out of the ground,6,Fear
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive,0,Neutral
He was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt,0,Neutral
He was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high-heeled buckled boots,0,Neutral
His blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice,0,Neutral
This mans name was Albus Dumbledore,2,Love
Albus Dumbledore did not seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome,4,Sad
He was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something,3,Excite
But he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street,6,Fear
For some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him,2,Love
He chuckled and muttered I should have known,1,Happy
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket,3,Excite
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter,0,Neutral
He flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it,0,Neutral
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop,4,Sad
He clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness,6,Fear
Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him,3,Excite
If anyone looked out of their window now even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley they would not be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement,4,Sad
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat,0,Neutral
He did not look at it but after a moment he spoke to it,1,Happy
He turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone,1,Happy
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes,0,Neutral
She too was wearing a cloak an emerald one,0,Neutral
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun,0,Neutral
She looked distinctly ruffled,6,Fear
My dear Professor I ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly,2,Love
You would be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said Professor McGonagall,5,Anger
All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here,1,Happy
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily,5,Anger
Oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently,5,Anger
Next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he could not explain how it had grown back so quickly,2,Love
You would think they had be a bit more careful but no even the Muggles have noticed somethings going on,4,Sad
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys dark living-room window,5,Anger
Flocks of owls shooting stars,0,Neutral
They were bound to notice something,6,Fear
Shooting stars down in Kent I will bet that was Dedalus Diggle,0,Neutral
You can not blame them said Dumbledore gently,4,Sad
We have had precious little to celebrate for eleven years,1,Happy
I know that said Professor McGonagall irritably,5,Anger
People are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in Muggle clothes swapping rumors,4,Sad
She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he did not so she went on,1,Happy
A fine thing it would be if on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last the Muggles found out about us all,1,Happy
I suppose he really has gone Dumbledore?,6,Fear
It certainly seems so said Dumbledore,1,Happy
We have much to be thankful for,2,Love
Would you care for a lemon drop?,2,Love
A lemon drop,0,Neutral
They are a kind of Muggle sweet I am rather fond of,2,Love
No thank you said Professor McGonagall coldly as though she did not think this was the moment for lemon drops,5,Anger
As I say even if You-Know-Who has gone -,4,Sad
My dear Professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this You- Know-Who nonsense for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name Voldemort,5,Anger
Professor McGonagall flinched but Dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice,5,Anger
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who,5,Anger
I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemorts name,5,Anger
I know you haven t said Professor McGonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring,2,Love
But you are different,2,Love
Everyone knows you are the only one You-Know- oh all right Voldemort was frightened of,6,Fear
You flatter me said Dumbledore calmly,2,Love
Voldemort had powers I will never have,4,Sad
Only because you are too well noble to use them,2,Love
Its lucky its dark,1,Happy
I have not blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs,2,Love
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around,5,Anger
You know what everyones saying? About why he is disappeared? About what finally stopped him?,6,Fear
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now,6,Fear
It was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true,4,Sad
Dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer,4,Sad
What they are saying she pressed on is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godrics Hollow,3,Excite
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are are that they are dead,4,Sad
Professor McGonagall gasped,6,Fear
Lily and James I can not believe it I did not want to believe it,6,Fear
Oh Albus,2,Love
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder,4,Sad
Professor McGonagalls voice trembled as she went on,6,Fear
They are saying he tried to kill the Potters son Harry,4,Sad
No one knows why or how but they are saying that when he could not kill Harry Potter Voldemorts power somehow broke and That is why he is gone,4,Sad
Its its true? faltered Professor McGonagall,6,Fear
After all he is done all the people he is killed he could not kill a little boy? Its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?,6,Fear
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles,4,Sad
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it,4,Sad
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead little planets were moving around the edge,0,Neutral
It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said Hagrids late,1,Happy
I suppose it was he who told you Id be here by the way?,1,Happy
Yes said Professor McGonagall,0,Neutral
And I do not suppose you are going to tell me why you are here of all places?,3,Excite
I have come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle,2,Love
You do not mean you can not mean the people who live here? cried Professor McGonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four,5,Anger
I have been watching them all day,2,Love
And theyve got this son I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets,4,Sad
Its the best place for him said Dumbledore firmly,2,Love
His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he is older,2,Love
I have written them a letter,2,Love
A letter? repeated Professor McGonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall,4,Sad
Really Dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him Hell be famous a legend I would not be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future there will be books written about Harry every child in our world will know his name,2,Love
Exactly said Dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses,1,Happy
Famous before he can walk and talk Famous for something he will not even remember can not you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until he is ready to take it?,4,Sad
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said Yes yes you are right of course,4,Sad
But how is the boy getting here Dumbledore? She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it,3,Excite
Hagrids bringing him,1,Happy
You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?,6,Fear
I would trust Hagrid with my life said Dumbledore,2,Love
I am not saying his heart is not in the right place said Professor McGonagall grudgingly but you can not pretend he is not careless,4,Sad
He does tend to what was that?,5,Anger
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them,5,Anger
It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them,3,Excite
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry,5,Anger
He was so angry he could hardly speak,5,Anger
He managed to say Go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy,1,Happy
If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it,3,Excite
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide,0,Neutral
He looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins,0,Neutral
In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets,0,Neutral
Hagrid said Dumbledore sounding relieved,1,Happy
At last,0,Neutral
And where did you get that motorcycle?,3,Excite
Borrowed it Professor Dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke,1,Happy
Young Sirius Black lent it to me,2,Love
I have got him sir,1,Happy
No problems were there?,5,Anger
No sir house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarming around,1,Happy
He fell asleep as we was flying over Bristol,2,Love
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets,2,Love
Inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep,2,Love
Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning,3,Excite
Is that where -? whispered Professor McGonagall,5,Anger
Yes said Dumbledore,0,Neutral
Couldnt you do something about it Dumbledore?,3,Excite
Even if I could I wouldnt,5,Anger
Scars can come in handy,2,Love
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground,0,Neutral
Well give him here Hagrid wed better get this over with,1,Happy
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house,0,Neutral
Could I could I say good-bye to him sir? asked Hagrid,4,Sad
He bent his great shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss,2,Love
Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog,4,Sad
Shhh hissed Professor McGonagall you will wake the Muggles,6,Fear
S-s-sorry sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it,4,Sad
But I c-c-cant stand it Lily and James dead and poor little Harry off to live with Muggles -,4,Sad
Yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or we will be found Professor McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door,4,Sad
He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to the other two,4,Sad
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrids shoulders shook Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out,3,Excite
Well said Dumbledore finally That is that,1,Happy
We have no business staying here,5,Anger
We may as well go and join the celebrations,1,Happy
Yeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice I will be taking Sirius his bike back,4,Sad
Gnight Professor McGonagall Professor Dumbledore sir,2,Love
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night,3,Excite
I shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall said Dumbledore nodding to her,2,Love
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply,4,Sad
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street,0,Neutral
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer,0,Neutral
He clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street,3,Excite
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four,4,Sad
Good luck Harry he murmured,2,Love
He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone,0,Neutral
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen,1,Happy
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up,1,Happy
One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs Dursleys scream,3,Excite
CHAPTER TWO,0,Neutral
THE VANISHING GLASS,0,Neutral
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all,0,Neutral
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys front door; it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls,0,Neutral
Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed,2,Love
Ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother,2,Love
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too,4,Sad
Yet Harry Potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long,4,Sad
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day,1,Happy
Up Get up Now,5,Anger
Harry woke with a start,6,Fear
His aunt rapped on the door again,5,Anger
Up she screeched,5,Anger
Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove,3,Excite
He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having,1,Happy
It had been a good one,1,Happy
He had a funny feeling he had had the same dream before,1,Happy
His aunt was back outside the door,0,Neutral
Are you up yet? she demanded,5,Anger
Nearly said Harry,0,Neutral
Well get a move on I want you to look after the bacon,2,Love
And do not you dare let it burn I want everything perfect on Duddys birthday,5,Anger
Harry groaned,5,Anger
What did you say? his aunt snapped through the door,5,Anger
Nothing nothing,6,Fear
Dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks,3,Excite
He found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on,4,Sad
Harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept,4,Sad
Once Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he had not been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar,4,Sad
Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses,4,Sad
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen,0,Neutral
The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudleys birthday presents,0,Neutral
It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike,1,Happy
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody,4,Sad
Dudleys favorite punching bag was Harry but he could not often catch him,4,Sad
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age,4,Sad
He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudleys and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was,4,Sad
Harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes,0,Neutral
He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose,4,Sad
The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning,2,Love
He had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it,1,Happy
In the car crash when your parents died she had said,4,Sad
And do not ask questions,5,Anger
Do not ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys,4,Sad
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon,0,Neutral
Comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting,2,Love
About once a week Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut,5,Anger
Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place,4,Sad
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother,0,Neutral
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon,0,Neutral
He had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head,0,Neutral
Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig,2,Love
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there was not much room,0,Neutral
Dudley meanwhile was counting his presents,1,Happy
Thirty-six he said looking up at his mother and father,2,Love
Darling you have not counted Auntie Marges present see its here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy,2,Love
All right thirty-seven then said Dudley going red in the face,5,Anger
Harry who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over,6,Fear
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly And well buy you another two presents while were out today,2,Love
Hows that popkin? Two more presents,2,Love
It looked like hard work,0,Neutral
Finally he said slowly So I will have thirty thirty,4,Sad
Thirty-nine sweetums said Aunt Petunia,2,Love
Oh,0,Neutral
Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel,4,Sad
Uncle Vernon chuckled,1,Happy
Little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father,2,Love
Atta boy Dudley He ruffled Dudleys hair,2,Love
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a VCR,1,Happy
He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried,4,Sad
Bad news Vernon she said,4,Sad
Mrs Figgs broken her leg,4,Sad
She jerked her head in Harrys direction,4,Sad
Dudleys mouth fell open in horror but Harrys heart gave a leap,6,Fear
Every year on Dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies,2,Love
Every year Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away,4,Sad
Harry hated it there,5,Anger
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned,1,Happy
Now what? said Aunt Petunia looking furiously at Harry as though he had planned this,5,Anger
Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg but it was not easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles Snowy Mr Paws and Tufty again,1,Happy
We could phone Marge Uncle Vernon suggested,3,Excite
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this as though he was not there or rather as though he was something very nasty that could not understand them like a slug,4,Sad
What about whats-her-name your friend Yvonne?,3,Excite
On vacation in Majorca snapped Aunt Petunia,5,Anger
You could just leave me here Harry put in hopefully he had be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudleys computer,1,Happy
Aunt Petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon,5,Anger
And come back and find the house in ruins? she snarled,5,Anger
I will not blow up the house said Harry but they were not listening,4,Sad
I suppose we could take him to the zoo said Aunt Petunia slowly,3,Excite
and leave him in the car,4,Sad
That cars new he is not sitting in it alone,6,Fear
Dudley began to cry loudly,4,Sad
In fact he was not really crying it had been years since he had really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted,1,Happy
Dinky Duddydums do not cry Mummy will not let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him,2,Love
I do not want him t-t-to come Dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs,5,Anger
He always sp- spoils everything He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms,5,Anger
Just then the doorbell rang Oh good Lord they are here said Aunt Petunia frantically and a moment later Dudleys best friend Piers Polkiss walked in with his mother,1,Happy
Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat,0,Neutral
He was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them,4,Sad
Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once,1,Happy
Half an hour later Harry who could not believe his luck was sitting in the back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life,3,Excite
His aunt and uncle had not been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they had left Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside,5,Anger
I am warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to Harrys I am warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you will be in that cupboard from now until Christmas,5,Anger
I am not going to do anything said Harry honestly,6,Fear
But Uncle Vernon did not believe him,4,Sad
The problem was strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he did not make them happen,4,Sad
Another time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleys brown with orange puff balls The harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly would not fit Harry,4,Sad
Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief Harry was not punished,1,Happy
On the other hand he had gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens,4,Sad
Dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney,3,Excite
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings,5,Anger
But all he had tried to do as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors,4,Sad
Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump,0,Neutral
It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that was not school his cupboard or Mrs Figgs cabbage-smelling living room,1,Happy
While he drove Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia,5,Anger
He liked to complain about things people at work Harry the council Harry the bank and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects,5,Anger
This morning it was motorcycles,0,Neutral
roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them,5,Anger
I had a dream about a motorcycle said Harry remembering suddenly,1,Happy
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front,6,Fear
He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache MOTORCYCLES do not FLY,5,Anger
Dudley and Piers sniggered,1,Happy
It was only a dream,0,Neutral
But he wished he had not said anything,4,Sad
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it should not no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas,5,Anger
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families,0,Neutral
The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop,4,Sad
It was not bad either Harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley except that it was not blond,1,Happy
Harry had the best morning he had had in a long time,1,Happy
He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime would not fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him,6,Fear
They ate in the zoo restaurant and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory did not have enough ice cream on top Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first,1,Happy
Harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last,4,Sad
After lunch they went to the reptile house,0,Neutral
It was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls,6,Fear
Behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone,6,Fear
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man-crushing pythons,3,Excite
Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place,1,Happy
It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it did not look in the mood,4,Sad
In fact it was fast asleep,0,Neutral
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils,3,Excite
Make it move he whined at his father,5,Anger
Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass but the snake did not budge,0,Neutral
Do it again Dudley ordered,5,Anger
Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on,1,Happy
This is boring Dudley moaned,4,Sad
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake,3,Excite
He would not have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long,4,Sad
It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house,4,Sad
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes,5,Anger
Slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys,0,Neutral
Harry stared,0,Neutral
Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching,3,Excite
He looked back at the snake and winked too,3,Excite
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling,1,Happy
It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly I get that all the time,4,Sad
I know Harry murmured through the glass though he was not sure the snake could hear him,3,Excite
The snake nodded vigorously,5,Anger
Where do you come from anyway? Harry asked,3,Excite
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass,0,Neutral
Boa Constrictor Brazil,0,Neutral
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on This specimen was bred in the zoo,0,Neutral
Oh I see so you have never been to Brazil?,4,Sad
As the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump,6,Fear
DUDLEY Mr DURSLEY COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE YOU will not BELIEVE WHAT ITS DOING,3,Excite
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could,3,Excite
Out of the way you he said punching Harry in the ribs,5,Anger
Caught by surprise Harry fell hard on the concrete floor,4,Sad
What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror,6,Fear
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished,6,Fear
The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor,3,Excite
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits,6,Fear
As the snake slid swiftly past him Harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said Brazil here I come,3,Excite
Thanksss amigo,2,Love
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock,6,Fear
But the glass he kept saying where did the glass go?,6,Fear
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again,4,Sad
Piers and Dudley could only gibber,1,Happy
As far as Harry had seen the snake had not done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernons car Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death,6,Fear
But worst of all for Harry at least was Piers calming down enough to say Harry was talking to it were not you Harry?,3,Excite
I have already got us some rations said Uncle Vernon so all aboard,3,Excite
He did not know what time it was and he could not be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet,4,Sad
Until they were he could not risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food,0,Neutral
Hed lived with the Dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since he had been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash,4,Sad
He could not remember being in the car when his parents had died,4,Sad
Sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead,4,Sad
This he supposed was the crash though he could not imagine where all the green light came from,6,Fear
He could not remember his parents at all,4,Sad
His aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions,4,Sad
There were no photographs of them in the house,4,Sad
When he had been younger Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family,2,Love
Yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him,1,Happy
Very strange strangers they were too,0,Neutral
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley,3,Excite
After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything,5,Anger
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus,2,Love
A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word,3,Excite
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look,3,Excite
At school Harry had no one,4,Sad
Everybody knew that Dudleys gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with Dudleys gang,6,Fear
CHAPTER THREE,0,Neutral
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE,0,Neutral
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment,4,Sad
By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches,4,Sad
Harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping Dudleys gang who visited the house every single day,4,Sad
Piers Dennis Malcolm and Gordon were all big and stupid but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader,5,Anger
The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudleys favorite sport Harry Hunting,1,Happy
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope,1,Happy
When September came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he would not be with Dudley,3,Excite
Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernons old private school Smeltings,1,Happy
Piers Polkiss was going there too,0,Neutral
Harry on the other hand was going to Stonewall High the local public school,0,Neutral
Dudley thought this was very funny,1,Happy
They stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,6,Fear
he told Harry,0,Neutral
Want to come upstairs and practice?,3,Excite
No thanks said Harry,0,Neutral
The poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick,5,Anger
Then he ran before Dudley could work out what he had said,6,Fear
One day in July Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform leaving Harry at Mrs Figgs,2,Love
Mrs Figg wasn t as bad as usual,1,Happy
It turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she did not seem quite as fond of them as before,5,Anger
She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years,1,Happy
That evening Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform,3,Excite
Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters,0,Neutral
They also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers were not looking,0,Neutral
This was supposed to be good training for later life,3,Excite
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life,2,Love
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she could not believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown-up,2,Love
Harry did not trust himself to speak,6,Fear
He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh,1,Happy
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast,6,Fear
It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink,0,Neutral
The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water,0,Neutral
Whats this? he asked Aunt Petunia,5,Anger
Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question,5,Anger
Your new school uniform she said,2,Love
Don't be stupid snapped Aunt Petunia,5,Anger
I am dyeing some of Dudleys old things gray for you,2,Love
It will look just like everyone elses when I have finished,1,Happy
Harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue,6,Fear
He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably,6,Fear
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harrys new uniform,5,Anger
Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table,3,Excite
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat,0,Neutral
Get the mail Dudley said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper,2,Love
Make Harry get it,5,Anger
Get the mail Harry,5,Anger
Make Dudley get it,5,Anger
Poke him with your Smelting stick Dudley,5,Anger
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail,1,Happy
Three things lay on the doormat a postcard from Uncle Vernons sister Marge who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for Harry,0,Neutral
Harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band,5,Anger
No one ever in his whole life had written to him,4,Sad
Who would? He had no friends no other relatives he did not belong to the library so he had never even got rude notes asking for books back,4,Sad
Yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake Mr H,3,Excite
Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emerald-green ink,0,Neutral
Turning the envelope over his hand trembling Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter H,6,Fear
Hurry up boy shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen,5,Anger
What are you doing checking for letter bombs? He chuckled at his own joke,1,Happy
Hagrid looked shocked,6,Fear
Sorry Harry said quickly,4,Sad
Harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter,6,Fear
He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope,3,Excite
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard,5,Anger
Marges ill he informed Aunt Petunia,4,Sad
Ate a funny whelk,0,Neutral
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon,3,Excite
That is mine said Harry trying to snatch it back,5,Anger
Whod be writing to you? sneered Uncle Vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it,5,Anger
His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights,6,Fear
And it did not stop there,0,Neutral
Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge,6,Fear
P-P-Petunia he gasped,6,Fear
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach,5,Anger
Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line,3,Excite
For a moment it looked as though she might faint,6,Fear
She clutched her throat and made a choking noise,6,Fear
Vernon Oh my goodness Vernon,6,Fear
They stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room,4,Sad
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick,5,Anger
I want to read that letter he said loudly,3,Excite
want to read it said Harry furiously as its mine,3,Excite
Get out both of you croaked Uncle Vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope,5,Anger
Harry did not move,0,Neutral
I WANT MY LETTER he shouted,5,Anger
Let me see it demanded Dudley,5,Anger
OUT roared Uncle Vernon and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them,5,Anger
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole,5,Anger
Dudley won so Harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor,4,Sad
Vernon Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You do not think they are watching the house?,6,Fear
Watching spying might be following us muttered Uncle Vernon wildly,5,Anger
But what should we do Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we do not want,6,Fear
Harry could see Uncle Vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen,1,Happy
If they do not get an answer Yes That is best we will not do anything,3,Excite
But,0,Neutral
I am not having one in the house Petunia did not we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense?,5,Anger
That evening when he got back from work Uncle Vernon did something he had never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard,2,Love
Wheres my letter? said Harry the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door,5,Anger
it was addressed to you by mistake said Uncle Vernon shortly,4,Sad
I have burned it,5,Anger
It was not a mistake said Harry angrily it had my cupboard on it,5,Anger
SILENCE yelled Uncle Vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling,5,Anger
He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful,1,Happy
Your aunt and I have been thinking you are really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudleys second bedroom,2,Love
Do not ask questions snapped his uncle,5,Anger
The Dursleys house had four bedrooms one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia one for visitors usually Uncle Vernons sister Marge one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that would not fit into his first bedroom,0,Neutral
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room,3,Excite
He sat down on the bed and stared around him,4,Sad
Nearly everything in here was broken,4,Sad
Other shelves were full of books,0,Neutral
They were the only things in the room that looked as though they had never been touched,4,Sad
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother I do not want him in there I need that room make him get out,5,Anger
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed,4,Sad
Yesterday he had have given anything to be up here,3,Excite
Today he had rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it,4,Sad
Next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet,4,Sad
Dudley was in shock,6,Fear
Hed screamed whacked his father with his Smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still did not have his room back,5,Anger
Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he had opened the letter in the hall,4,Sad
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly,4,Sad
When the mail arrived Uncle Vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry made Dudley go and get it,2,Love
They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall,5,Anger
Then he shouted there is another one Mr H,3,Excite
Potter The Smallest Bedroom 4 Privet Drive,0,Neutral
With a strangled cry Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall Harry right behind him,6,Fear
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind,5,Anger
After a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick Uncle Vernon straightened up gasping for breath with Harrys letter clutched in his hand,5,Anger
Go to your cupboard I mean your bedroom he wheezed at Harry,5,Anger
Dudley go just go,0,Neutral
Harry walked round and round his new room,3,Excite
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he had not received his first letter,3,Excite
Surely that meant they had try again? And this time he had make sure they did not fail,3,Excite
The repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning,3,Excite
He mustnt wake the Dursleys,6,Fear
He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights,6,Fear
It was freezing in the boat,6,Fear
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces,1,Happy
After what seemed like hours they reached the rock where Uncle Vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken-down house,6,Fear
Well I do not like saying the name if I can help it,6,Fear
No one does,0,Neutral
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first,3,Excite
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door Harry leapt into the air; he had trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face,6,Fear
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that Harry did not do exactly what he had been trying to do,3,Excite
He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea,5,Anger
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into Uncle Vernons lap,4,Sad
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink,1,Happy
I want he began but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes,4,Sad
Uncle Vernon did not go to work that day,4,Sad
He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot,0,Neutral
See he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails if they can not deliver them they will just give up,1,Happy

On Saturday things began to get out of hand,4,Sad
Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window,1,Happy
While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor,4,Sad
Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly? Dudley asked Harry in amazement,3,Excite
On Sunday morning Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy,1,Happy
No post on Sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today,1,Happy
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head,3,Excite
Next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets,6,Fear
The Dursleys ducked but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one,3,Excite
Out OUT,5,Anger
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall,5,Anger
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut,5,Anger
They could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor,3,Excite
That does it said Uncle Vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time,5,Anger
I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave,2,Love
No arguments,5,Anger
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue,5,Anger
Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway,3,Excite
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television VCR and computer in his sports bag,4,Sad
They drove,0,Neutral
And they drove,0,Neutral
Even Aunt Petunia did not dare ask where they were going,6,Fear
Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while,3,Excite
Shakeem off shake them off he would mutter whenever he did this,3,Excite
They did not stop to eat or drink all day,4,Sad
By nightfall Dudley was howling,4,Sad
Hed never had such a bad day in his life,4,Sad
He was hungry he had missed five television programs he had wanted to see and he had never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer,5,Anger
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city,6,Fear
Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets,4,Sad
Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering,3,Excite

Found the perfect place he said,1,Happy
It was very cold outside the car,6,Fear
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea,3,Excite

One thing was certain there was no television in there,4,Sad
Storm forecast for tonight said Uncle Vernon gleefully clapping his hands together,1,Happy
And this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat,2,Love
A toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them,6,Fear

There were only two rooms,0,Neutral
Uncle Vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas,0,Neutral
He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up,4,Sad
Could do with some of those letters now eh? he said cheerfully,1,Happy
He was in a very good mood,1,Happy
Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail,4,Sad
Harry privately agreed though the thought did not cheer him up at all,4,Sad
As night fell the promised storm blew up around them,6,Fear
Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows,6,Fear
Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa,0,Neutral
She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket,1,Happy
The storm raged more and more for ociously as the night went on,6,Fear
Harry could not sleep,4,Sad
He shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger,4,Sad
Dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight,1,Happy
The lighted dial of Dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told Harry he had be eleven in ten minutes time,2,Love
He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now,3,Excite
Harry heard something creak outside,6,Fear
He hoped the roof was not going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did,6,Fear
Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he had be able to steal one somehow,3,Excite
Was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that? And two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he had be eleven,3,Excite

There was a pause,0,Neutral
Then,0,Neutral
SMASH,0,Neutral
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor,6,Fear
His face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair,0,Neutral
The giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling,3,Excite
He bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame,0,Neutral
Couldnt make us a cup of tea could you? Its not been an easy journey,2,Love
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear,6,Fear
Budge up you great lump said the stranger,5,Anger
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind Uncle Vernon,6,Fear
Harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile,2,Love
Last time I saw you you was only a baby said the giant,2,Love
you look a lot like you are dad but you have got you are moms eyes,2,Love
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise,1,Happy
I demand that you leave at once sit he said,5,Anger
You are breaking and entering,5,Anger
Ah shut up Dursley you great prune said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room,5,Anger
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on,1,Happy
Anyway Harry said the giant turning his back on the Dursleys a very happy birthday to you,2,Love
Got something for you here I mighta sat on it at some point but it will taste all right,2,Love
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box,3,Excite
Harry opened it with trembling fingers,6,Fear
Inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing,2,Love
He meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was Who are you?,3,Excite
The giant chuckled,1,Happy
Rubeus Hagrid Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts,0,Neutral
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harrys whole arm,3,Excite
What about that tea then eh? he said rubbing his hands together,1,Happy
Id not say no to something stronger if you have got it mind,1,Happy
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted,1,Happy
He bent down over the fireplace; they could not see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there,3,Excite
It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he had sunk into a hot bath,2,Love
The giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea,2,Love
Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage,1,Happy
Nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker Dudley fidgeted a little,1,Happy
Uncle Vernon said sharply do not touch anything he gives you Dudley,5,Anger
The giant chuckled darkly,1,Happy
Your great pudding of a son do not need fattening anymore Dursley do not worry,1,Happy
He passed the sausages to Harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still could not take his eyes off the giant,2,Love
Finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said I am sorry but I still do not really know who you are,3,Excite
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand,1,Happy
Call me Hagrid he said everyone does,2,Love
and like I told you I am Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts you will know all about Hogwarts of course,3,Excite
Sorry? barked Hagrid turning to stare at the Dursleys who shrank back into the shadows,5,Anger
It s them as should be sorry I knew you were not getting your letters but I never thought you would not even know abou Hogwarts for crying out loud Did you never wonder where you are parents learned it all?,5,Anger
ALL WHAT? Hagrid thundered,5,Anger
In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut,5,Anger
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall,6,Fear
Do you mean to tell me he growled at the Dursleys that this boy this boy knows nothing abou about ANYTHING?,5,Anger
Harry thought this was going a bit far,6,Fear
He had been to school after all and his marks were not bad,1,Happy

You are famous,1,Happy
What? My my mom and dad were not famous were they?,2,Love

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice,1,Happy
Stop he commanded,5,Anger
Stop right there sit I forbid you to tell the boy anything,5,Anger
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage,5,Anger
You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left for him? I was there I saw Dumbledore leave it Dursley and you have kept it from him all these years?,5,Anger
STOP I FORBID YOU yelled Uncle Vernon in panic,5,Anger
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror,6,Fear
Ah go boil you are heads both of you said Hagrid,5,Anger
There was silence inside the hut,6,Fear

A wizard of course said Hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumping goodun Id say once you have been trained up a bit,2,Love

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly,3,Excite
Where was I? said Hagrid but at that moment Uncle Vernon still ashen-faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight,5,Anger
Hagrid grunted,5,Anger
A Muggle said Hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like them,0,Neutral
An its your bad luck you grew up in a family of the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on,4,Sad

Knew Of course we knew How could you not be my dratted sister being what she was? Oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats,5,Anger
I was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak But for my mother and father oh no it was Lily this and Lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family,2,Love
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on,5,Anger
It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years,4,Sad
Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you and of course I knew youd be just the same just as strange just as as abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you,5,Anger
Harry had gone very white,6,Fear
As soon as he found his voice he said Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash,4,Sad
CAR CRASH roared Hagrid jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner,5,Anger
How could a car crash kill Lily and James Potter? Its an outrage A scandal Harry Potter not knowing his own story when every kid in our world knows his name But why? What happened? Harry asked urgently,3,Excite
The anger faded from Hagrids face,4,Sad
He looked suddenly anxious,4,Sad
I never expected this he said in a low worried voice,4,Sad
I had no idea when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble getting hold of you how much you did not know,4,Sad
Ah Harry I do not know if I am the right person to tell you but someones gotta you can not go off to Hogwarts not knowing,2,Love
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys,5,Anger
Well its best you know as much as I can tell you mind I can not tell you everythin its a great mystry parts of it,4,Sad

Horribly,0,Neutral
One of the only safe places left was Hogwarts,1,Happy
Reckon Dumbledores the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of,1,Happy
Didnt dare try taking the school not just then anyway,1,Happy
Now your mum and dad were as good a witch and wizard as I ever knew,2,Love
Head boy and girl at Hogwarts in their day Suppose the mystry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get them on his side before probably knew they were too close to Dumbledore to want anything to do with the Dark Side,4,Sad
Maybe he thought he could persuade them maybe he just wanted them out of the way,3,Excite
All anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you were all living on Halloween ten years ago,2,Love
You were just a year old,2,Love
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn,4,Sad
Sorry he said,4,Sad
But its that sad knew your mum and dad and nicer people you could not find anyway,2,Love
You-Know-Who killed em,4,Sad
and then and this is the real mystry of the thing he tried to kill you too,4,Sad
Wanted to make a clean job of it I suppose or maybe he just liked killing by then,3,Excite
Never wondered how you got that mark on your forehead? That was no ordinary cut,3,Excite
That is what you get when a Powerful evil curse touches you took care of your mum and dad and your house even but it did not work on you and That is why your famous Harry,2,Love
No one ever lived after he decided to kill them no one except you and he had killed some of the best witches and wizards of the age the McKinnons the Bones the Prewetts and you was only a baby and you lived,2,Love
Something very painful was going on in Harrys mind,4,Sad
As Hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh,3,Excite
Hagrid was watching him sadly,4,Sad
Took you from the ruined house myself on Dumbledores orders,2,Love
Brought you to this lot,2,Love
Load of old tosh said Uncle Vernon,5,Anger
Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there,6,Fear
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage,1,Happy
He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched,5,Anger
Now you listen here boy he snarled I accept there is something strange about you probably nothing a good beating would not have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what I expected always knew they had come to a sticky end,4,Sad
But at that moment Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat,5,Anger
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword he said I am warning you Dursley I am warning you one more word,5,Anger
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant Uncle Vernons courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent,6,Fear
That is better said Hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor,1,Happy
Harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them,3,Excite
But what happened to Vol-- sorry I mean You-Know-Who?,3,Excite

Some say he is still out there biding his time like but I do not believe it,6,Fear
People who was on his side came back to ours,1,Happy
Do not reckon they couldve done if he was coming back,1,Happy
Most of us reckon he is still out there somewhere but lost his powers,6,Fear
Too weak to carry on,4,Sad
Cause something about you finished him Harry,1,Happy
There was something going on that night he had not counted on I do not know what it was no one does but something about you stumped him all right,1,Happy
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but Harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake,2,Love
A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? he had spent his life being clouted by Dudley and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon,4,Sad
if he was really a wizard why had not they been turned into warty toads every time they had tried to lock him in his cupboard?,3,Excite
If he had once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?,4,Sad
Hagrid he said quietly I think you must have made a mistake,4,Sad
To his surprise Hagrid chuckled,1,Happy
Not a wizard eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?,1,Happy
Now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he Harry had been upset or angry,5,Anger
chased by Dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach,1,Happy
dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he had managed to make it grow back and the very last time Dudley had hit him had not he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it?,1,Happy
Hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid smiling and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him,2,Love
Harry Potter not a wizard you wait you will be right famous at Hogwarts,1,Happy
But Uncle Vernon was not going to give in without a fight,4,Sad
Havent I told you he is not going? he hissed,5,Anger
He is going to Stonewall High and hell be grateful for it,1,Happy
I have read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and,5,Anger
If he wants to go a great Muggle like you will not stop him growled Hagrid,4,Sad

What sort of magic do you teach Professor Quirrell?,3,Excite
Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head NEVER he thundered - INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDOREIN- FRONT- OF- ME,5,Anger
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker,3,Excite
a sharp squeal and the next second Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain,4,Sad
When he turned his back on them Harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousers,6,Fear
Uncle Vernon roared,5,Anger
Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them,6,Fear
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard,1,Happy
Shouldnt have lost me temper he said ruefully but it did not work anyway,4,Sad
Meant to turn him into a pig but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there was not much left to do,1,Happy
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows,1,Happy
Be grateful if you did not mention that to anyone at Hogwarts he said,2,Love
I am er not supposed to do magic strictly speaking,4,Sad
I was allowed to do a bit to follow you and get your letters to you and stuff one of the reasons I was so keen to take on the job Why are not you supposed to do magic? asked Harry,3,Excite

DIAGON ALLEY,0,Neutral
Harry woke early the next morning,1,Happy
Although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight,1,Happy

And there is Aunt Petunia knocking on the door Harry thought his heart sinking,4,Sad

The hut was full of sunlight the storm was over Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak,0,Neutral
Harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him,1,Happy
The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid who did not wake up,1,Happy
The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrids coat,1,Happy
Do not do that,5,Anger
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat,1,Happy
Hagrid said Harry loudly,2,Love

Hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags,0,Neutral

He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture,4,Sad
Um Hagrid?,0,Neutral
Mm? said Hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots,0,Neutral
I have not got any money and you heard Uncle Vernon last night he will not pay for me to go and learn magic,4,Sad

Seems a shame to row though said Hagrid giving Harry another of his sideways looks,1,Happy
If I was to er speed things up a bit would you mind not mentioning it at Hogwarts?,2,Love
Of course not said Harry eager to see more magic,3,Excite
Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land,1,Happy
Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts? Harry asked,3,Excite

P-P-Potter stammered Professor Quirrell grasping Harrys hand c-cant t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you,1,Happy
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper the Daily Prophet,1,Happy
Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult he had never had so many questions in his life,1,Happy
Ministry of Magic messing things up as usual Hagrid muttered turning the page,4,Sad
Theres a Ministry of Magic? Harry asked before he could stop himself,3,Excite

They wanted Dumbledore for Minister of course but he had never leave Hogwarts so old Cornelius Fudge got the job,1,Happy
Bungler if ever there was one,0,Neutral
So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning asking for advice,4,Sad

Well their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there is still witches and wizards up and down the country,0,Neutral
Why?,0,Neutral
Why? Blimey Harry everyoned be wanting magic solutions to their problems,1,Happy
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall,1,Happy
Hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street,1,Happy
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station,6,Fear
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly See that Harry? Things these Muggles dream up eh?,1,Happy

There was a train to London in five minutes time,3,Excite
Hagrid who did not understand Muggle money as he called it gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets,4,Sad
People stared more than ever on the train,5,Anger
Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent,1,Happy

Harry had never been to London before,4,Sad
Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way,4,Sad
He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow,5,Anger
I do not know how the Muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops,5,Anger
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him,1,Happy
They passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand,4,Sad
This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people,1,Happy
Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?,3,Excite
We are there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?,6,Fear
Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?,6,Fear
If Harry had not known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so,1,Happy
You are somehow even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable Harry could not help trusting him,2,Love
This is it said Hagrid coming to a halt the Leaky Cauldron,1,Happy
It was a tiny grubby-looking pub,0,Neutral
If Hagrid had not pointed it out Harry would not have noticed it was there,4,Sad
The people hurrying by did not glance at it,4,Sad
Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they could not see the Leaky Cauldron at all,3,Excite
In fact Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it,3,Excite
Before he could mention this Hagrid had steered him inside,1,Happy
For a famous place it was very dark and shabby,6,Fear
A few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry,1,Happy
One of them was smoking a long pipe,0,Neutral
A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut,0,Neutral
The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in,6,Fear
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying The usual Hagrid?,1,Happy
Cant Tom I am on Hogwarts business said Hagrid clapping his great hand on Harrys shoulder and making Harrys knees buckle,1,Happy
Good Lord said the bartender peering at Harry is this can this be?,1,Happy
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent,6,Fear
Bless my soul whispered the old bartender Harry Potter what an honor,2,Love
He hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward Harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes,1,Happy
Welcome back Mr Potter welcome back,1,Happy
Harry did not know what to say,6,Fear
Everyone was looking at him,1,Happy
Hagrid was beaming,2,Love
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron,3,Excite
Doris Crockford Mr Potter can not believe I am meeting you at last,1,Happy
So proud Mr Potter I am just so proud,1,Happy
Always wanted to shake your hand I am all of a flutter,1,Happy

He remembers cried Dedalus Diggle looking around at everyone,1,Happy
Did you hear that? He remembers me Harry shook hands again and again Doris Crockford kept coming back for more,1,Happy
A pale young man made his way forward very nervously,6,Fear
One of his eyes was twitching,6,Fear
Professor Quirrell said Hagrid,0,Neutral

N-not that you n-need it eh P-P-Potter? He laughed nervously,1,Happy
You will be g-getting all your equipment I suppose? I have g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires m-myself,1,Happy
He looked terrified at the very thought,6,Fear
But the others would not let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself,3,Excite
At last Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble,1,Happy
Must get on lots to buy,1,Happy
Come on Harry,2,Love
Doris Crockford shook Harrys hand one last time and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds,1,Happy
Hagrid grinned at Harry,2,Love
Told you did not I? Told you you was famous,3,Excite
Even Professor Quirrell was trembling to meet you mind you he is usually trembling,1,Happy
Oh yeah,0,Neutral
Poor bloke,4,Sad
Brilliant mind,1,Happy
He was fine while he was studying out of books but then he took a year off to get some firsthand experience,1,Happy
They say he met vampires in the Black Forest and there was a nasty bit of trouble with a hag never been the same since,4,Sad
Scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrella?,4,Sad
Hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can,1,Happy
Three up two across he muttered,0,Neutral
Right stand back Harry,6,Fear
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella,3,Excite
The brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight,3,Excite
Welcome said Hagrid to Diagon Alley,2,Love
He grinned at Harrys amazement,2,Love
Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall,6,Fear
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop,1,Happy
Cauldrons All Sizes - Copper Brass Pewter Silver Self-Stirring Collapsible said a sign hanging over them,0,Neutral
Yeah you will be needing one said Hagrid but we gotta get your money first,1,Happy
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes,3,Excite
He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping,3,Excite
A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying Dragon liver seventeen Sickles an ounce they are mad,5,Anger
A low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium Tawny Screech Barn Brown and Snowy,0,Neutral
Several boys of about Harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it,3,Excite
Look Harry heard one of them say the new Nimbus Two Thousand fastest ever There were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels,3,Excite
Gringotts said Hagrid,0,Neutral
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops,0,Neutral
Standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was - Yeah That is a goblin said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him,3,Excite
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry,0,Neutral
He had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and Harry noticed very long fingers and feet,6,Fear
He bowed as they walked inside,2,Love
Now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them Enter stranger but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed For those who take but do not earn Must pay most dearly in their turn,0,Neutral
So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours Thief you have been warned beware Of finding more than treasure there,0,Neutral
Like I said youd be mad to try and rob it said Hagrid,6,Fear
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall,3,Excite
About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses,1,Happy
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall and you are more goblins were showing people in and out of these,1,Happy
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter,1,Happy
Morning said Hagrid to a free goblin,2,Love
We have come to take some money out of Mr Harry Potters safe,3,Excite
You have his key Sir?,6,Fear
Got it here somewhere said Hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers,1,Happy
The goblin wrinkled his nose,5,Anger
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals,6,Fear
Got it said Hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key,1,Happy
An I have also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore said Hagrid importantly throwing out his chest,1,Happy
Its about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen,3,Excite
The goblin read the letter carefully,6,Fear
Very well he said handing it back to Hagrid I will have Someone take you down to both vaults,1,Happy
Griphook,0,Neutral
Griphook was you are another goblin,0,Neutral
Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall,1,Happy
Whats the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen? Harry asked,3,Excite
Cant tell you that said Hagrid mysteriously,4,Sad
Very secret,6,Fear
Hogwarts business,0,Neutral
Dumbledores trusted me,2,Love
Griphook held the door open for them,2,Love
Harry who had expected more marble was surprised,3,Excite
They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches,6,Fear
It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor,6,Fear
Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them,3,Excite
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages,6,Fear
Harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible,4,Sad
The rattling cart seemed to know its own way because Griphook was not steering,6,Fear
Harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open,4,Sad
Once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late,6,Fear
they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor,3,Excite
I never know Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?,3,Excite
and he said people from Muggle families should not even be allowed in,4,Sad
An do not ask me questions just now I think I am gonna be sick,5,Anger
He did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling,6,Fear
Griphook unlocked the door,0,Neutral
A lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared Harry gasped,6,Fear
Inside were mounds of gold coins,2,Love
All yours smiled Hagrid,2,Love
All Harrys it was incredible,2,Love
The Dursleys could not have known about this or they had have had it from him faster than blinking,6,Fear
How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under London,1,Happy
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag,1,Happy
The gold ones are Galleons he explained,2,Love
Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle its easy enough,2,Love
Right that should be enough for a couple of terms well keep the rest safe for you,1,Happy
He turned to Griphook,0,Neutral
Vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly?,4,Sad
One speed only said Griphook,1,Happy
They were going even deeper now and gathering speed,6,Fear
The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners,6,Fear
They went rattling over an underground ravine and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck,6,Fear
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole,3,Excite
Stand back said Griphook importantly,5,Anger
He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away,3,Excite
If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that they had be sucked through the door and trapped in there said Griphook,1,Happy
How often do you check to see if anyones inside? Harry asked,3,Excite
About once every ten years said Griphook with a rather nasty grin,1,Happy
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault Harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty,4,Sad
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor,1,Happy
Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat,1,Happy
Harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask,4,Sad
Come on back in this infernal cart and do not talk to me on the way back its best if I keep me mouth shut said Hagrid,5,Anger
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts,1,Happy
Harry did not know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money,1,Happy
He did not have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he had had in his whole life more money than even Dudley had ever had,2,Love
Might as well get your uniform said Hagrid nodding toward Madam Malkins Robes for All Occasions,2,Love
Listen Harry would you mind if I slipped off for a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts,1,Happy
He did still look a bit sick so Harry entered Madam Malkins shop alone feeling nervous,4,Sad
Madam Malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve,1,Happy
Hogwarts dear? she said when Harry started to speak,2,Love
Got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact,1,Happy
In the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes,3,Excite
Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length,1,Happy
My fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy,2,Love
Then I am going to drag them off to took at racing brooms,3,Excite
I do not see why first years can not have their own,4,Sad
I think I will bully father into getting me one and I will smuggle it in somehow,5,Anger
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley,2,Love
No Harry said again wondering what on earth Quidditch could be,4,Sad
I do Father says its a crime if I am not picked to play for my house and I must say I agree,2,Love
Know what house you will be in yet?,0,Neutral

Well no one really knows until they get there do they but I know I will be in Slytherin all our family have been imagine being in Hufflepuff I think Id leave would not you? Mmm said Harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting,4,Sad
I say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window,3,Excite
Hagrid was standing there grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he could not come in,2,Love
That is Hagrid said Harry pleased to know something the boy didnt,2,Love
He works at Hogwarts,1,Happy
He is the gamekeeper said Harry,1,Happy
He was liking the boy less and less every second,5,Anger
I heard he is a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed,4,Sad
I think he is brilliant said Harry coldly,2,Love
Do you? said the boy with a slight sneer,5,Anger
Why is he with you? Where are your parents?,2,Love
They are dead said Harry shortly,4,Sad
He did not feel much like going into the matter with this boy,5,Anger
Oh sorry said the other,4,Sad
They were a witch and wizard if That is what you mean,1,Happy
I really do not think they should let the other sort in do you? They are just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways,5,Anger
Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter imagine,4,Sad
I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families,1,Happy
But before Harry could answer Madam Malkin said That is you done my dear and Harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool,1,Happy
Well I will see you at Hogwarts I suppose said the drawling boy,3,Excite
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts,4,Sad
Whats up? said Hagrid,2,Love
They stopped to buy parchment and quills,0,Neutral
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote,1,Happy
When they had left the shop he said Hagrid whats Quidditch?,3,Excite
Do not make me feel worse said Harry,4,Sad
He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkins,2,Love
Oh Neville he heard the old woman sigh,4,Sad
You are not from a Muggle family,1,Happy
If he had known who you were he is grown up knowing your name if his parents are wizarding folk,1,Happy

You-Know-Who was one,6,Fear
They bought Harrys school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather,1,Happy
Even Dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these,3,Excite
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges Hair Loss Jelly-Legs Tongue- Tying and Much Much More by Professor Vindictus Viridian,4,Sad
I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley,5,Anger
I am not saying That is not a good idea but your not to use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances said Hagrid,4,Sad
An anyway you couldn work any of them curses you are you will need a lot more study before you get to that level,4,Sad
Hagrid would not let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron either It says pewter on your list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope,3,Excite
Then they visited the Apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages,6,Fear
Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling,6,Fear
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule glittery-black beetle eyes five Knuts a scoop,3,Excite
Outside the Apothecary Hagrid checked Harrys list again,1,Happy
Just your wand left - A yeah and I still have not got you a birthday present,2,Love

Twenty minutes later they left Eeylops Owl Emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel-bright eyes,1,Happy
Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing,2,Love
He could not stop stammering his thanks sounding just like Professor Quirrell,2,Love
Do not mention it said Hagrid gruffly,1,Happy
Do not expect you have had a lotta presents from them Dursleys,4,Sad
Just Ollivanders left now - only place for wands Ollivanders and you gotta have the best wand,1,Happy
A magic wand this was what Harry had been really looking forward to,2,Love
The last shop was narrow and shabby,6,Fear
Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC,0,Neutral
A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window,0,Neutral
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside,1,Happy
It was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait,1,Happy
Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling,6,Fear
For some reason the back of his neck prickled,6,Fear
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic,6,Fear
Good afternoon said a soft voice,6,Fear
Harry jumped,6,Fear
Hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair,6,Fear
An old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop,6,Fear
Ah yes said the man,0,Neutral

Well I say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of course,1,Happy
Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose,3,Excite
Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes,6,Fear
And That is where,0,Neutral

Hmmm said Mr Ollivander giving Hagrid a piercing look,5,Anger

Harry did not say anything,4,Sad
Hold out your arm,0,Neutral
That is it,0,Neutral
He measured Harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head,3,Excite
As he measured he said Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance Mr Potter,3,Excite
We use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons,1,Happy
No two Ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same,1,Happy
And of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand,1,Happy
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own,6,Fear
Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes,3,Excite
That will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor,1,Happy
Try this one,2,Love

Tricky customer eh? Not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere I wonder now - - yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple,2,Love
Harry took the wand,0,Neutral
He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers,2,Love
He raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls,2,Love
Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried Oh bravo Yes indeed oh very good,2,Love
He put Harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering Curious curious,2,Love
Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare,6,Fear
I remember every wand I have ever sold Mr Potter,1,Happy
Every single wand,0,Neutral
It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other,3,Excite
It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar,4,Sad
Harry swallowed,6,Fear
Yes thirteen-and-a-half inches,0,Neutral

After all He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things terrible yes but great,1,Happy
Harry shivered,6,Fear
He was not sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much,6,Fear
He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his shop,1,Happy
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley back through the wall back through the Leaky Cauldron now empty,1,Happy
Harry did not speak at all as they walked down the road,4,Sad
he did not even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harrys lap,4,Sad
Up another escalator out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder,4,Sad

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them,2,Love
You all right Harry? your very quiet said Hagrid,2,Love

Everyone thinks I am special he said at last,2,Love
All those people in the Leaky Cauldron Professor Quirrell Mr Ollivander but I do not know anything about magic at all,4,Sad
How can they expect great things? I am famous and I can not even remember what I am famous for,4,Sad
I do not know what happened when Vol- sorry I mean the night my parents died,4,Sad
Hagrid leaned across the table,2,Love
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile,2,Love

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS,0,Neutral
Harrys last month with the Dursleys was not fun,4,Sad
True Dudley was now so scared of Harry he would not stay in the same room,6,Fear
while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon did not shut Harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they did not speak to him at all,4,Sad
Half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty,6,Fear
Although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while,4,Sad
Harry kept to his room with his new owl for company,1,Happy
He had decided to call her Hedwig a name he had found in A History of Magic,2,Love
He lay on his bed reading late into the night Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased,3,Excite
It was lucky that Aunt Petunia did not come in to vacuum anymore because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice,4,Sad
Every night before he went to sleep Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to September the first,3,Excite
On the last day of August he thought he had better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to Kings Cross station the next day,6,Fear

Have a good term said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile,1,Happy
He left without another word,5,Anger
Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away,4,Sad
All three of them were laughing,2,Love
Harrys mouth went rather dry,6,Fear
What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of Hedwig,6,Fear
Hed have to ask someone,6,Fear
He stopped a passing guard but did not dare mention platform nine and three-quarters,6,Fear
The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry could not even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though Harry was being stupid on purpose,5,Anger
Getting desperate Harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there was not one,4,Sad
In the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters,5,Anger
Harry was now trying hard not to panic,6,Fear
According to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it,4,Sad
he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl,4,Sad
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley,4,Sad
He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and ten,3,Excite
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying,3,Excite
packed with Muggles of course,5,Anger
The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair,0,Neutral
Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harrys in front of him and they had an owl,3,Excite
Heart hammering Harry pushed his cart after them,3,Excite
They stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying,1,Happy
Now whats the platform number? said the boys mother,3,Excite
Nine and three-quarters piped a small girl also red-headed who was holding her hand Mom can not I go,0,Neutral
You are not old enough Ginny now be quiet,5,Anger
All right Percy you go first,2,Love
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten,3,Excite
Harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished,4,Sad
Fred you next the plump woman said,2,Love
Honestly woman you call yourself our mother? can not you tell I am George?,5,Anger
Sorry George dear,4,Sad
Only joking I am Fred said the boy and off he went,1,Happy
His twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he was not anywhere,6,Fear
Excuse me Harry said to the plump woman,1,Happy
Hello dear she said,2,Love
First time at Hogwarts? Rons new too,2,Love
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons,1,Happy
He was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose,0,Neutral
Yes said Harry,0,Neutral
The thing is the thing is I do not know how to,4,Sad
How to get onto the platform? she said kindly and Harry nodded,2,Love
All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten,3,Excite
Do not stop and do not be scared you will crash into it That is very important,3,Excite
Best do it at a bit of a run if you are nervous,1,Happy
Go on go now before Ron,1,Happy
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier,6,Fear
It looked very solid,0,Neutral
People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten,1,Happy
He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he had be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer,4,Sad
he would not be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash It did not come he kept on running he opened his eyes,6,Fear
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people,3,Excite
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express eleven Oclock,3,Excite
Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it He had done it,1,Happy
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs,1,Happy
Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks,1,Happy
The first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats,2,Love
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat,1,Happy
He passed a round-faced boy who was saying Gran I have lost my toad again,4,Sad
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd,3,Excite
Give us a look Lee go on,2,Love
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg,6,Fear
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train,0,Neutral
He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door,0,Neutral
He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot,4,Sad
Want a hand? It was one of the red-haired twins he had followed through the barrier,2,Love
Yes please Harry panted,1,Happy
Oy Fred Come here and help,1,Happy
With the twins help Harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment,2,Love
Thanks said Harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes,1,Happy
Whats that? said one of the twins suddenly pointing at Harrys lightning scar,6,Fear
Arent you? he added to Harry,1,Happy
Oh him said Harry,2,Love
I mean yes I am,1,Happy
The two boys gawked at him and Harry felt himself turning red,2,Love
Then to his relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door,1,Happy
Fred? George? Are you there?,6,Fear
Coming Mom,1,Happy
With a last look at Harry the twins hopped off the train,1,Happy
Harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying,3,Excite
Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief,0,Neutral
Ron you have got something on your nose,0,Neutral
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose,2,Love

The oldest boy came striding into sight,1,Happy
He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it,3,Excite
Cant stay long Mother he said,4,Sad
I am up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves,1,Happy
Oh are you a prefect Percy? said one of the twins with an air of great surprise,2,Love
You should have said something we had no idea,3,Excite

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left,2,Love
Now you two this year you behave yourselves,2,Love

Blown up a toilet? We have never blown up a toilet,3,Excite
And look after Ron,2,Love
Do not worry ickle Ronniekins is safe with us,2,Love
Shut up said Ron again,5,Anger
He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it,1,Happy
Hey Mom guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?,3,Excite
Harry leaned back quickly so they could not see him looking,6,Fear
You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?,3,Excite
Who?,0,Neutral
Harry Potter,0,Neutral
Harry heard the little girls voice,1,Happy
Oh Mom can I go on the train and see him Mom eh please,3,Excite

Asked him,0,Neutral
Saw his scar,0,Neutral
Poor dear - no wonder he was alone I wondered,4,Sad
He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform,2,Love
Never mind that do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?,3,Excite
Their mother suddenly became very stern,5,Anger
I forbid you to ask him Fred,5,Anger
No do not you dare,5,Anger
As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school,5,Anger
All right keep your hair on,1,Happy
A whistle sounded,0,Neutral
Hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train,1,Happy
They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye and their younger sister began to cry,2,Love
Do not Ginny well send you loads of owls,2,Love
Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat,1,Happy
George,0,Neutral
Only joking Mom,1,Happy
Harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved,2,Love
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner,4,Sad
Houses flashed past the window,0,Neutral
He did not know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind,3,Excite
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in,1,Happy
Anyone sitting there? he asked pointing at the seat opposite Harry,1,Happy
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down,1,Happy
He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he had not looked,6,Fear
Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose,1,Happy
Hey Ron,0,Neutral
The twins were back,0,Neutral

He pointed at Harrys forehead,0,Neutral
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar,3,Excite
Ron stared,6,Fear
So That is where You-Know-Who Yes said Harry but I can not remember it,4,Sad
Well I remember a lot of green light but nothing else,4,Sad
Wow said Ron,0,Neutral
He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again,6,Fear
Are all your family wizards? asked Harry who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him,3,Excite
Er Yes I think so said Ron,1,Happy
I think Moms got a second cousin who is an accountant but we never talk about him,2,Love
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about,1,Happy
Horrible -well not all of them,5,Anger
My aunt and uncle and cousin are though,2,Love
Five said Ron,0,Neutral
For some reason he was looking gloomy,4,Sad
I am the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts,0,Neutral
You could say I have got a lot to live up to,4,Sad
Bill and Charlie have already left Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch,3,Excite
Now Percys a prefect,1,Happy
Fred and George mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they are really funny,2,Love
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if I do its no big deal because they did it first,4,Sad
You never get anything new either with five brothers,4,Sad
I have got Bills old robes Charlies old wand and Percys old rat,4,Sad
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep,2,Love
His names Scabbers and he is useless he hardly ever wakes up,2,Love
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they could not afford I mean I got Scabbers instead,4,Sad
Rons ears went pink,6,Fear
He seemed to think he had said too much because he went back to staring out of the window,6,Fear
Harry did not think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl,1,Happy
After all he had never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told Ron so all about having to wear Dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents,4,Sad
This seemed to cheer Ron up,2,Love
and until Hagrid told me I did not know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort,3,Excite
Ron gasped,6,Fear
You said You-Know-Whos name said Ron sounding both shocked and impressed,6,Fear
I am not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said Harry I just never knew you shouldnt,4,Sad
I bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately I bet I am the worst in the class,4,Sad
You will not be,2,Love
Theres loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough,1,Happy
While they had been talking the train had carried them out of London,0,Neutral
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep,0,Neutral
They were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past,0,Neutral
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said Anything off the cart dears?,1,Happy
Harry who had not had any breakfast leapt to his feet but Rons ears went pink again and he muttered that he had brought sandwiches,4,Sad
Harry went out into the corridor,0,Neutral
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry but the woman did not have Mars Bars,4,Sad
What she did have were Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans Droobles Best Blowing Gum Chocolate Frogs,0,Neutral
Pumpkin Pasties Cauldron Cakes Licorice Wands and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life,3,Excite
Not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts,3,Excite
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat,3,Excite
Hungry are you?,1,Happy
Starving said Harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty,1,Happy
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it,1,Happy
There were four sandwiches inside,1,Happy
He pulled one of them apart and said She always forgets I do not like corned beef,4,Sad
Swap you for one of these said Harry holding up a pasty,2,Love
Go on,0,Neutral
You do not want this its all dry said Ron,4,Sad
She has not got much time he added quickly you know with five of us,4,Sad
Go on have a pasty said Harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with,2,Love
It was a nice feeling sitting there with Ron eating their way through all Harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten,2,Love
What are these? Harry asked Ron holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs,3,Excite
They are not really frogs are they? He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him,6,Fear
No said Ron,0,Neutral
But see what the card is,0,Neutral
I am missing Agrippa,0,Neutral
What?,0,Neutral
Oh of course you would not know Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards,3,Excite
I have got about five hundred but I have not got Agrippa or Ptolemy,3,Excite
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card,3,Excite
It showed a mans face,0,Neutral
He wore half- moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache,0,Neutral
Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore,2,Love
Do not tell me youd never heard of Dumbledore said Ron,4,Sad
Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa thanks Harry turned over his card and read ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS,3,Excite
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling,0,Neutral
Harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that Dumbledores face had disappeared,6,Fear
He is gone,0,Neutral
Well you can not expect him to hang around all day said Ron,1,Happy
Hell be back,0,Neutral
No I have got Morgana again and I have got about six of her do you want it? You can start collecting,2,Love
Rons eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped,2,Love
Help yourself said Harry,2,Love
But in you know the Muggle world people just stay put in photos,4,Sad
Do they? What they do not move at all? Ron sounded amazed,3,Excite
weird,0,Neutral
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile,2,Love
Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards but Harry could not keep his eyes off them,3,Excite
Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana but Hengist of Woodcroft Alberic Grunnion Circe Paracelsus and Merlin,0,Neutral
He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans,3,Excite
You want to be careful with those Ron warned Harry,6,Fear
When they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe,1,Happy
Ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner,6,Fear
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans,1,Happy
Harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron would not touch which turned out to be pepper,1,Happy
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder,0,Neutral
The neat fields had gone,0,Neutral
Now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills,6,Fear
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in,1,Happy
He looked tearful,4,Sad
Sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all?,4,Sad
When they shook their heads he wailed I have lost him He keeps getting away from me,4,Sad
Hell turn up said Harry,2,Love
Do not know why he is so bothered said Ron,4,Sad
If Id brought a toad Id lose it as quick as I could,1,Happy
Mind you I brought Scabbers so I can not talk,4,Sad
The rat was still snoozing on Rons lap,2,Love
He might have died and you would not know the difference said Ron in disgust,4,Sad
I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell did not work,4,Sad
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand,4,Sad
It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end,4,Sad
Anyway He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again,1,Happy
The toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him,3,Excite
She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes,0,Neutral
Has anyone seen a toad? Nevilles lost one she said,4,Sad
She had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth,0,Neutral
We have already told him we have not seen it said Ron but the girl was not listening she was looking at the wand in his hand,3,Excite
She sat down,0,Neutral
Ron looked taken aback,6,Fear
Er all right,0,Neutral
Sunshine daisies butter mellow Turn this stupid fat rat yellow,0,Neutral
Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep,0,Neutral
Are you sure That is a real spell? said the girl,6,Fear
Well its not very good is it? I have tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me,1,Happy
Nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter but I was ever so pleased of course,1,Happy
I mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is I have heard,1,Happy
I have learned all our course books by heart of course I just hope it will be enough I am Hermione Granger by the way who are you,3,Excite
Harry looked at Ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he had not learned all the course books by heart either,1,Happy
Harry Potter said Harry,0,Neutral
I know all about you of course I got a few extra books,3,Excite
for background reading and you are in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century,3,Excite
Goodness did not you know Id have found out everything I could if it was me said Hermione,4,Sad
Do either of you know what house you will be in? I have been asking around and I hope I am in Gryffindor it sounds by far the best,2,Love
I hear Dumbledore himself was in it but I suppose Ravenclaw would not be too bad,3,Excite
Anyway wed better go and look for Nevilles toad,3,Excite
You two had better change you know I expect we will be there soon,1,Happy
And she left taking the toadless boy with her,1,Happy
Whatever house I am in I hope shes not in it said Ron,5,Anger
Stupid spell George gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud,5,Anger
What house are your brothers in? asked Harry,3,Excite
Gryffindor said Ron,0,Neutral
Gloom seemed to be settling on him again,4,Sad
Mom and Dad were in it too,2,Love
I do not suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in Slytherin,6,Fear
That is the house Vol- I mean You-Know-Who was in?,3,Excite

He flopped back into his seat looking depressed,4,Sad
You know I think the ends of Scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter,4,Sad
said Harry trying to take Rons mind off houses,2,Love
So what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway?,3,Excite
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he had finished school,3,Excite
Charlies in Romania studying dragons and Bills in Africa doing something for Gringotts said Ron,1,Happy
Did you hear about Gringotts? Its been all over the Daily Prophet but I do not suppose you get that with the Muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault,3,Excite
Harry stared,6,Fear
My dad says it must have been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts but they do not think they took anything That is whats odd,6,Fear
Course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Whos behind it,6,Fear
He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned,6,Fear
He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying Voldemort without worrying,4,Sad
Whats your Quidditch team? Ron asked,0,Neutral
Er I do not know any Harry confessed,0,Neutral
What Ron looked dumbfounded,6,Fear
Oh you wait its the best game in the world And he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players,3,Excite
describing famous games he had been to with his brothers and the broomstick he had like to get if he had the money,3,Excite
He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yey again but it was not Neville the toadless boy or Hermione Granger this time,3,Excite
Three boys entered and Harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from Madam Malkins robe shop,1,Happy
He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he had shown back in Diagon Alley,1,Happy
They are saying all down the train that Harry Potters in this compartment,1,Happy
Oh honestly do not you two read? Look read that there,5,Anger
Yes said Harry,0,Neutral
He was looking at the other boys,1,Happy
Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean,6,Fear
Standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards,6,Fear
Oh this is Crabbe and this is Goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where Harry was looking,1,Happy
And my names Malfoy Draco Malfoy,0,Neutral
Ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget,1,Happy
Draco Malfoy looked at him,0,Neutral
Think my names funny do you? No need to ask who you are,5,Anger
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford,4,Sad
He turned back to Harry,0,Neutral
You will soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others Potter,2,Love
You do not want to go making friends with the wrong sort,2,Love
I can help you there,2,Love
He held out his hand to shake Harrys but Harry did not take it,5,Anger
I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly,5,Anger
Draco Malfoy did not go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks,5,Anger
Id be careful if I were you Potter he said slowly,5,Anger
Unless you are a bit politer you will go the same way as your parents,4,Sad
They did not know what was good for them either,4,Sad
You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid and it will rub off on you,5,Anger
Both Harry and Ron stood up,5,Anger
Say that again Ron said his face as red as his hair,5,Anger
Oh you are going to fight us are you? Malfoy sneered,5,Anger
Unless you get out now said Harry more bravely than he felt because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron,6,Fear
But we do not feel like leaving do we boys? We have eaten all our food and you still seem to have some,3,Excite
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward but before he had so much as touched Goyle Goyle let out a horrible yell,6,Fear
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyles knuckle,6,Fear
Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round howling and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once,6,Fear
Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps they had heard footsteps because a second later Hermione Granger had come in,6,Fear
What has been going on? she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail,3,Excite
I think he is been knocked out Ron said to Harry,4,Sad
No I do not believe it he is gone back to sleep-,2,Love
And so he had,0,Neutral
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley,1,Happy
I have heard of his family said Ron darkly,6,Fear
They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared,6,Fear
My dad does not believe it,5,Anger
He says Malfoys father did not need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side,4,Sad
He turned to Hermione,0,Neutral
You would better hurry up and put your robes on I have just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there,3,Excite
You have not been fighting have you? you will be in trouble before we even get there,4,Sad
Scabbers has been fighting not us said Ron scowling at her,5,Anger
Would you mind leaving while we change?,1,Happy
All right I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said Hermione in a sniffy voice,5,Anger
And you have got dirt on your nose by the way did you know?,2,Love
Ron glared at her as she left,5,Anger
It was getting dark,6,Fear
He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky,6,Fear
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes,0,Neutral
Rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them,4,Sad
A voice echoed through the train We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes time,3,Excite
Please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately,3,Excite
Harrys stomach lurched with nerves and Ron he saw looked pale under his freckles,6,Fear
They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor,3,Excite
The train slowed right down and finally stopped,1,Happy
People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform,6,Fear
Harry shivered in the cold night air,6,Fear
Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and Harry heard a familiar voice First years First years over here All right there Harry?,2,Love
Hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads,2,Love
Come on follow me any more first years? Mind your step now first years follow me,1,Happy
Slipping and stumbling they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path,6,Fear
It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there,6,Fear
Nobody spoke much,4,Sad
Neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice,6,Fear
You all get your first sight of Hogwarts in a sec Hagrid called over his shoulder just round this bend here,3,Excite
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake,6,Fear
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers,3,Excite
No more than four to a boat Hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore,1,Happy
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione,2,Love
Everyone in? shouted Hagrid who had a boat to himself,1,Happy
Right then FORWARD,0,Neutral
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass,2,Love
Everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead,3,Excite
It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood,3,Excite
Heads down yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff,5,Anger
they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face,1,Happy
They were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles,3,Excite
Oy you there Is this your toad? said Hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them,2,Love
Trevor cried Neville blissfully holding out his hands,2,Love
Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle,0,Neutral
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge Oak front door,0,Neutral
Everyone here? You there still got your toad?,2,Love
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door,3,Excite
CHAPTER SEVEN,0,Neutral
THE SORTING HAT,0,Neutral
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet,3,Excite
He was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there,2,Love
The door swung open at once,0,Neutral
A tall black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there,0,Neutral
She had a very stern face and Harrys first thought was that this was not someone to cross,6,Fear
The first years Professor McGonagall said Hagrid,1,Happy
Thank you Hagrid,2,Love
I will take them from here,1,Happy
She pulled the door wide,0,Neutral
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys house in it,3,Excite
The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors,3,Excite
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor,0,Neutral
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right,1,Happy
the rest of the school must already be here but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall,1,Happy
They crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously,6,Fear
Welcome to Hogwarts said Professor McGonagall,2,Love
The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the Great Hall you will be sorted into your houses,3,Excite
The Sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts,2,Love
You will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room,1,Happy
The four houses are called Gryffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin,1,Happy
Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards,3,Excite
While you are at Hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points,1,Happy
At the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor,2,Love
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours,3,Excite
The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school,3,Excite
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting,2,Love
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on Rons smudged nose,5,Anger
Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair,6,Fear
I shall return when we are ready for you said Professor McGonagall,3,Excite
Please wait quietly,0,Neutral
She left the chamber,0,Neutral
Harry swallowed,6,Fear
How exactly do they sort us into houses? he asked Ron,3,Excite
Some sort of test I think,6,Fear
Fred said it hurts a lot but I think he was joking,6,Fear
Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt,6,Fear
A test? In front of the whole school?,6,Fear
But he did not know any magic you are what on earth would he have to do?,6,Fear
He had not expected something like this the moment they arrived,4,Sad
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too,6,Fear
No one was talking much except Hermione Granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need,3,Excite
Harry tried hard not to listen to her,5,Anger
Hed never been more nervous never not even when he had had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he had somehow turned his teachers wig blue,6,Fear
Any second now Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom,3,Excite
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed,6,Fear
What the?,0,Neutral
He gasped,6,Fear
So did the people around him,0,Neutral
About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall,6,Fear
Pearly-white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years,6,Fear
They seemed to be arguing,5,Anger
What looked like a fat little monk was saying Forgive and forget I say we ought to give him a second chance,2,Love
My dear Friar have not we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know he is not really even a ghost I say what are you all doing here?,5,Anger
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years,3,Excite
Nobody answered,0,Neutral
New students said the Fat Friar smiling around at them,2,Love
About to be Sorted I suppose?,1,Happy
A few people nodded mutely,6,Fear
Hope to see you in Hufflepuff said the Friar,2,Love
My old house you know,1,Happy
Move along now said a sharp voice,5,Anger
Professor McGonagall had returned,0,Neutral
One by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall,4,Sad
Now form a line Professor McGonagall told the first years and follow me,0,Neutral
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with Ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall,3,Excite
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place,3,Excite
It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting,0,Neutral
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets,0,Neutral
At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting,0,Neutral
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them,1,Happy
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight,6,Fear
Dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver,6,Fear
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars,3,Excite
He heard Hermione whisper Its bewitched to look like the sky outside,3,Excite
I read about it in Hogwarts A History,0,Neutral
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the Great Hall did not simply open on to the heavens,3,Excite
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years,3,Excite
On top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat,0,Neutral
This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty,4,Sad
Aunt Petunia would not have let it in the house,4,Sad
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it Harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too,6,Fear
For a few seconds there was complete silence,4,Sad
Then the hat twitched,6,Fear
A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing Oh you may not think I am pretty But do not judge on what you see I will eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me,2,Love
You can keep your bowlers black Your top hats sleek and tall For I am the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all,0,Neutral
Theres nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can not see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be,2,Love
Welcome he said,2,Love
Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts Before we begin our banquet I would like to say a few words,2,Love
And here they are Nitwit Blubber Oddment Tweak Thank you,1,Happy
He sat back down,0,Neutral
Everybody clapped and cheered,1,Happy
Harry did not know whether to laugh or not,6,Fear
Is he a bit mad? he asked Percy uncertainly,5,Anger
You might belong in Gryffindor Where dwell the brave at heart Their daring nerve and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart,1,Happy
You might belong in Hufflepuff Where they are just and loyal Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil,1,Happy
Or you are in wise old Ravenclaw if you have a ready mind Where those of wit and learning Will always find their kind,1,Happy
Or perhaps in Slytherin you will make your real friends Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends,1,Happy
So put me on do not be afraid And do not get in a flap you are in safe hands though I have none For I am a Thinking Cap,1,Happy
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song,1,Happy
It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again,2,Love
So we have just got to try on the hat Ron whispered to Harry,1,Happy
I will kill Fred he was going on about wrestling a troll,5,Anger
Harry,0,Neutral
smiled weakly,4,Sad
Yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching,4,Sad
The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry did not feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment,4,Sad
If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him,4,Sad
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment,0,Neutral
When I call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said,1,Happy
Abbott Hannah,0,Neutral
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down,6,Fear
A moments pause HUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat,3,Excite
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table,1,Happy
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her,2,Love
Bones Susan,0,Neutral
HUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat again and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah,1,Happy
Boot Terry,0,Neutral
RAVENCLAW,0,Neutral
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them,1,Happy
Brocklehurst Mandy went to Ravenclaw too but Brown Lavender,1,Happy
became the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Rons twin brothers catcalling,1,Happy
Bulstrode Millicent then became a Slytherin,1,Happy
Perhaps it was Harrys imagination after all he had heard about Slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot,4,Sad
He was starting to feel definitely sick now,4,Sad
He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school,1,Happy
He had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him,4,Sad
Finch-Fletchley Justin,0,Neutral
HUFFLEPUFF,0,Neutral
Sometimes Harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide,3,Excite
Finnigan Seamus the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor,1,Happy
Granger Hermione,0,Neutral
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head,3,Excite
GRYFFINDOR shouted the hat,0,Neutral
Ron groaned,5,Anger
A horrible thought struck Harry as horrible thoughts always do when you are very nervous,6,Fear
What if he was not chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he had better get back on the train?,6,Fear
When Neville Longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool,4,Sad
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville,4,Sad
When it finally shouted GRYFFINDOR Neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to MacDougal Morag,1,Happy
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed SLYTHERIN,1,Happy
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle looking pleased with himself,2,Love
Moon Nott Parkinson then a pair of twin girls Patil and Patil then Perks Sally-Anne and then at last Potter Harry,3,Excite
As Harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall,3,Excite
Potter did she say?,1,Happy
The Harry Potter?,0,Neutral
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him,3,Excite
Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat,0,Neutral
He waited,0,Neutral
Difficult,0,Neutral
Very difficult,0,Neutral
Plenty of courage I see,1,Happy
Not a bad mind either,1,Happy
Theres talent A my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now That is interesting,1,Happy
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought Not Slytherin not Slytherin,6,Fear
Are you sure? You could be great you know its all here in your head and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no? Well if you are sure better be GRYFFINDOR,3,Excite
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall,1,Happy
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table,3,Excite
He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet,1,Happy
Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the Weasley twins yelled We got Potter We got Potter Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he had seen earlier,1,Happy
The ghost patted his arm giving Harry the sudden horrible feeling he had just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water,6,Fear
He could see the High Table properly now,0,Neutral
At the end nearest him sat Hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up,2,Love
Harry grinned back,2,Love
And there in the center of the High Table in a large gold chair sat Albus Dumbledore,2,Love
Harry recognized him at once from the card he had gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train,2,Love
Dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts,0,Neutral
Harry spotted Professor Quirtell too the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron,4,Sad
He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban,3,Excite
And now there were only three people left to be sorted,1,Happy
Thomas Dean,0,Neutral
a Black boy even taller than Ron joined Harry at the Gryffindor table,3,Excite
Turpin Lisa became a Ravenclaw and then it was Rons turn,3,Excite
He was pale green by now,6,Fear
Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted GRYFFINDOR,2,Love
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him,1,Happy
Well done Ron excellent said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as Zabini Blaise was made a Slytherin,1,Happy
Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away,0,Neutral
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate,4,Sad
He had only just realized how hungry he was,4,Sad
Lucky this plant things here really said Ron,1,Happy
Mad? said Percy airily,5,Anger
He is a genius Best wizard in the world But he is a bit mad yes,1,Happy
Potatoes Harry?,2,Love
Harrys mouth fell open,1,Happy
The dishes in front of him were now piled with food,3,Excite
He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table,1,Happy
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry but he had never been allowed to eat as much as he liked,4,Sad
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted even if It made him sick,5,Anger
Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat,3,Excite
It was all delicious,2,Love
That does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching Harry cut up his steak can not you?,4,Sad
I have not eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost,4,Sad
I do not think I have in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service,1,Happy
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower,6,Fear
My brothers told me about you you are Nearly Headless Nick,3,Excite
I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted,5,Anger
Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?,3,Excite
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat was not going at all the way he wanted,5,Anger
Like this he said irritably,5,Anger
His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge,6,Fear
Someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly,6,Fear
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said So new Gryffindors,3,Excite
I hope you are going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning,4,Sad
Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row The Bloody Barons becoming almost unbearable he is the Slytherin ghost,5,Anger
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood,6,Fear
He was right next to Malfoy who Harry was pleased to see did not look too pleased with the seating arrangements,2,Love
How did he get covered in blood? asked Seamus with great interest,3,Excite
I have never asked said Nearly Headless Nick delicately,4,Sad
When everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before,3,Excite
A moment later the desserts appeared,3,Excite
Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries Jell-O rice pudding,2,Love
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families,2,Love
I am half-and-half said Seamus,0,Neutral
Me dads a Muggle,0,Neutral
Mom did not tell him she was a witch til after they were married,4,Sad
Bit of a nasty shock for him,6,Fear
The others laughed,1,Happy
Well my gran brought me up and shes a witch said Neville but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages,4,Sad
My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once I nearly drowned but nothing happened until I was eight,4,Sad
Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go,6,Fear
But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road,3,Excite
They were all really pleased Gran was crying she was so happy,2,Love
And you should have seen their faces when I got in here they thought I might not be magic enough to come you see,3,Excite
Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad,2,Love
On Harrys other side Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons,3,Excite
I do hope they start right away there is so much to learn,3,Excite
I am particularly interested in Transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult,4,Sad
You will be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing,1,Happy
Harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the High Table again,2,Love
Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet,1,Happy
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore,0,Neutral
Professor Quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin,1,Happy
It happened very suddenly,0,Neutral
The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrells turban straight into Harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on Harrys forehead,6,Fear
Ouch Harry clapped a hand to his head,6,Fear
What is it? asked Percy,2,Love
N-nothing,0,Neutral
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come,1,Happy
Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he did not like Harry at all,4,Sad
Whos that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? he asked Percy,3,Excite
Oh you know Quirrell already do you? No wonder he is looking so nervous That is Professor Snape,1,Happy
He teaches Potions but he does not want to everyone knows he is after Quirrells job,0,Neutral
Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts Snape,6,Fear
Harry watched Snape for a while but Snape did not look at him again,4,Sad
At last the desserts too disappeared and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again,1,Happy
The hall fell silent,4,Sad
Ahern just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered,2,Love
I have a few start-of-term notices to give you,1,Happy
First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils,6,Fear
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well,1,Happy
Dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins,2,Love
I have also been asked by Mr Filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors,4,Sad
Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term,1,Happy
Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch,1,Happy
And finally I must tell you that this year the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death,6,Fear
Harry laughed but he was one of the few who did,6,Fear
Must be said Percy frowning at Dumbledore,4,Sad
Its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that,4,Sad
I do think he might have told us prefects at least,4,Sad
And now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried Dumbledore,2,Love
Harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed,1,Happy
Lets try again,1,Happy
Potter where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?,5,Anger
Lucky shrieked Hermione,1,Happy
Look at you both,2,Love
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words,3,Excite
Everyone pick their favorite tune said Dumbledore and off we go,2,Love
And the school bellowed Hogwarts Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us something please,2,Love
Everybody finished the song at different times,4,Sad
At last only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march,4,Sad
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest,2,Love
Ah music he said wiping his eyes,2,Love
A magic beyond all we do here And now bedtime,2,Love
Off you trot,0,Neutral
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds out of the Great Hall and up the marble staircase,1,Happy
Harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food,4,Sad
He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries,3,Excite
They climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt,3,Excite
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him,5,Anger
Peeves Percy whispered to the first years,0,Neutral
A poltergeist,6,Fear
He raised his voice Peeves show yourself,5,Anger
A loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered,5,Anger
Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?,5,Anger
There was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross- legged in the air clutching the walking sticks,1,Happy
Oooooooh he said with an evil cackle,5,Anger
Ickle Firsties What fun,2,Love
He swooped suddenly at them,6,Fear
They all ducked,6,Fear
Go away Peeves or the Baronll hear about this I mean it barked Percy,5,Anger
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on Nevilles head,5,Anger
They heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed,1,Happy
You want to watch out for Peeves said Percy as they set off again,6,Fear
The Bloody Barons the only one who can control him he will not even listen to us prefects,5,Anger
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress,2,Love
Password? she said,0,Neutral
Caput Draconis said Percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall,3,Excite
They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs,2,Love
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another,1,Happy
At the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four-posters hung with deep red velvet curtains,1,Happy
Their trunks had already been brought up,2,Love
Too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed,1,Happy
Great food is not it? Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings,1,Happy
Get off Scabbers He is chewing my sheets,5,Anger
Harry was going to ask Ron if he had had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once,1,Happy
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream,1,Happy
He was wearing Professor Quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once because it was his destiny,6,Fear
Harry told the turban he did not want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier,6,Fear
he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was Malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher Snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke sweating and shaking,6,Fear
He rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he did not remember the dream at all,1,Happy
CHAPTER EIGHT,0,Neutral
THE POTIONS MASTER,0,Neutral
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day,4,Sad
People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring,4,Sad
Harry wished they would not because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes,4,Sad
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts wide sweeping ones; narrow rickety ones,3,Excite
some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump,1,Happy
Then there were doors that would not open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that were not really doors at all but solid walls just pretending,3,Excite
It was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot,4,Sad
The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk,3,Excite
It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open,6,Fear
Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class,4,Sad
He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech GOT YOUR CONK,6,Fear
Even worse than Peeves if that was possible was the caretaker Argus Filch,5,Anger
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning,4,Sad
Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor,6,Fear
He would not believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell who was passing,2,Love
Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris a scrawny dust-colored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like Filchs,6,Fear
She patrolled the corridors alone,6,Fear
Break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for Filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later,6,Fear
Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the Weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts,1,Happy
The students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick,5,Anger
And then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves,1,Happy
There was a lot more to magic as Harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words,4,Sad
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets,3,Excite
Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for,3,Excite
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic which was the only one taught by a ghost,4,Sad
Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him,6,Fear
Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up,4,Sad
Professor Flitwick the Charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk,1,Happy
At the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached Harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight,2,Love
Harry had been quite right to think she was not a teacher to cross,6,Fear
Strict and clever she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class,6,Fear
Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts she said,6,Fear
Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back,6,Fear
You have been warned,5,Anger
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again,3,Excite
They were all very impressed and could not wait to get started but soon realized they were not going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time,4,Sad
After taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle,3,Excite
By the end of the lesson only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match,1,Happy
Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile,2,Love
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts but Quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke,4,Sad
His classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he had met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days,3,Excite
His turban he told them had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they were not sure they believed this story,4,Sad
For one thing when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather,6,Fear
for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went,1,Happy
Harry was very relieved to find out that he was not miles behind everyone else,1,Happy
Lots of people had come from Muggle families and like him had not had any idea that they were witches and wizards,1,Happy
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron did not have much of a head start,4,Sad
They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once,1,Happy
What have we got today? Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge,3,Excite
Double Potions with the Slytherins said Ron,3,Excite
Snapes Head of Slytherin House,0,Neutral
They say he always favors them we will be able to see if its true,3,Excite
Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House but it had not stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before,4,Sad
Harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps,3,Excite
Hedwig had not brought Harry anything so far,4,Sad
She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls,2,Love
This morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harrys plate,3,Excite
It said in a very untidy scrawl Dear Harry I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week,2,Love
Send us an answer back with Hedwig,2,Love
Hagrid Harry borrowed Rons quill scribbled Yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent Hedwig off again,2,Love
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far,4,Sad
At the start-of-term banquet Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him,4,Sad
By the end of the first Potions lesson he knew he had been wrong,4,Sad
Snape did not dislike Harry he hated him,4,Sad
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons,6,Fear
It was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls,6,Fear
Snape like Flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like Flitwick he paused at Harrys name,3,Excite
Our new celebrity,1,Happy
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands,1,Happy
Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class,3,Excite
His eyes were black like Hagrids but they had none of Hagrids warmth,4,Sad
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels,6,Fear
You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began,1,Happy
He spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like Professor McGonagall Snape had y caught every word like Professor McGonagall Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort,6,Fear
As there is little foolish wand-waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic,3,Excite
I do not expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses,6,Fear
I can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you are not as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach,1,Happy
More silence followed this little speech,6,Fear
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows,3,Excite
Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she was not a dunderhead,1,Happy
Potter said Snape suddenly,6,Fear
What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?,5,Anger
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron who looked as stumped as he was; Hermiones hand had shot into the air,6,Fear
Snapes lips curled into a sneer,5,Anger
He ignored Hermiones hand,5,Anger
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but Harry did not have the faintest idea what a bezoar was,4,Sad
He tried not to look at Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle who were shaking with laughter,1,Happy
Thought you would not open a book before coming eh Potter? Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes,4,Sad
He had looked through his books at the Dursleys but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermiones quivering hand,4,Sad
What is the difference Potter between monkshood and wolfsbane?,3,Excite
At this Hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling,3,Excite
I think Hermione does though why do not you try her?,5,Anger
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamuss eye and Seamus winked,1,Happy
Snape however was not pleased,4,Sad
Sit down he snapped at Hermione,5,Anger
For your information Potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death,3,Excite
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons,3,Excite
As for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite,3,Excite
Well? Why are not you all copying that down?,5,Anger
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment,3,Excite
Over the noise Snape said And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek Potter,5,Anger
Things did not improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued,4,Sad
Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils,3,Excite
He swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy whom he seemed to like,5,Anger
He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon,3,Excite
Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes,6,Fear
Within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs,4,Sad
Idiot boy snarled Snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand,5,Anger
I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?,5,Anger
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose,4,Sad
Take him up to the hospital wing Snape spat at Seamus,5,Anger
Then he rounded on Harry and Ron who had been working next to Neville,3,Excite
You Potter why did not you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he had make you look good if he got it wrong did you? That is another point you have lost for Gryffindor,5,Anger
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron,5,Anger
Do not push it he muttered I have heard Snape can turn very nasty,6,Fear
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later Harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low,4,Sad
Hed lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week why did Snape hate him so much? Cheer up,4,Sad
said Ron Snapes always taking points off Fred and George,4,Sad
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?,2,Love
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds,1,Happy
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest,0,Neutral
A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door,6,Fear
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks,6,Fear
Then Hagrids voice rang out saying Back Fang back,5,Anger
Hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open,1,Happy
Hang on he said,1,Happy
Back Fang,0,Neutral
He let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound,6,Fear
There was only one room inside,0,Neutral
Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it,0,Neutral
Make yourselves at home said Hagrid letting go of Fang who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears,2,Love
Like Hagrid Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked,2,Love
This is Ron Harry told Hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate,2,Love
Another Weasley eh? said Hagrid glancing at Rons freckles,2,Love
I spent half me life chasing your twin brothers away from the forest,4,Sad
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons,3,Excite
Fang rested his head on Harrys knee and drooled all over his robes,2,Love
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch that old git,1,Happy
An as for that cat Mrs Norris Id like to introduce her to Fang sometime,2,Love
Do you know every time I go up to the school she follows me everywhere? can not get rid of her Fitch puts her up to it,4,Sad
Hagrid like Ron told Harry not to worry about it that Snape liked hardly any of the students,4,Sad
But he seemed to really hate me,5,Anger
Rubbish said Hagrid,5,Anger
Yet Harry could not help thinking that Hagrid did not quite meet his eyes when he said that,4,Sad
Hows your brother Charlie? Hagrid asked Ron,2,Love
I liked him a lot great with animals,2,Love
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose,1,Happy
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlies work with dragons Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy,1,Happy
It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown,3,Excite
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken,1,Happy
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day,1,Happy
But were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon,5,Anger
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts but Ron had not mentioned the date,4,Sad
Hagrid said Harry that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday It mightve been happening while we were there,3,Excite
None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing You leave those brooms where they are or you will be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch,2,Love
Come on dear,2,Love
Neville his face tear-streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with Madam Hooch who had her arm around him,2,Love
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter,1,Happy
Did you see his face the great lump?,1,Happy
The other Slytherins joined in,1,Happy
Shut up Malfoy snapped Parvati Patil,5,Anger
There was no doubt about it Hagrid definitely did not meet Harrys eyes this time,6,Fear
He grunted and offered him another rock cake,2,Love
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day,1,Happy
Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package,1,Happy
Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they had been too polite to refuse Harry thought that none of the lessons he had had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid,2,Love
Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he did not want to tell Harry? CHAPTER NINE,3,Excite
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL,0,Neutral
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley but that was before he met Draco Malfoy,5,Anger
Still first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins so they did not have to put up with Malfoy much,1,Happy
Or at least they did not until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan,4,Sad
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together,3,Excite
Typical said Harry darkly,5,Anger
Just what I always wanted,2,Love
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy,4,Sad
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else,3,Excite
You do not know that you will make a fool of yourself said Ron reasonably,2,Love
Anyway I know Malfoys always going on about how good he is at Quidditch but I bet That is all talk,1,Happy
Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot,3,Excite
He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters,1,Happy
He was not the only one though the way Seamus Finnigan told it he had spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick,2,Love
Even Ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time he had almost hit a hang glider on Charlies old broom,1,Happy
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly,3,Excite
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer,5,Anger
Ron could not see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly,3,Excite
Harry had caught Ron prodding Deans poster of West Ham soccer team trying to make the players move,3,Excite
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one,4,Sad
Privately Harry felt shed had good reason because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground,4,Sad
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was,6,Fear
This was something you could not learn by heart out of a book not that she had not tried,4,Sad
At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages,4,Sad
Neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when Hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail,1,Happy
Harry had not had a single letter since Hagrids note something that Malfoy had been quick to notice of course,3,Excite
Malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table,2,Love
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother,1,Happy
He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke,3,Excite
Gran knows I forget things this tells you if there is something you have forgotten to do,3,Excite
Look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh His face fell because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you have forgotten something,3,Excite
Neville was trying to remember what he had forgotten when Draco Malfoy who was passing the Gryffindor table snatched the Remembrall out of his hand,4,Sad
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet,5,Anger
They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay but Professor McGonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash,6,Fear
Whats going on?,3,Excite
Malfoys got my Remembrall Professor,0,Neutral
Scowling Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table,5,Anger
Just looking he said and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him,5,Anger
At three-thirty that afternoon Harry Ron and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson,3,Excite
It was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance,0,Neutral
The Slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground,3,Excite
Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left,4,Sad
Their teacher Madam Hooch arrived,0,Neutral
She had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk,0,Neutral
Well what are you all waiting for? she barked,5,Anger
Everyone stand by a broomstick,0,Neutral
Harry glanced down at his broom,0,Neutral
Stick out your right hand over your broom called Madam Hooch at the front and say Up UPF everyone shouted,5,Anger
Harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did,3,Excite
Hermione Grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and Nevilles had not moved at all,4,Sad
Perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought Harry; there was a quaver in Nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground,6,Fear
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips,1,Happy
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he had been doing it wrong for years,2,Love
Now when I blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said Madam Hooch,3,Excite
Keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly,0,Neutral
On my whistle three two,0,Neutral
But Neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochs lips,6,Fear
Come back boy she shouted but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet,6,Fear
Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and WHAM a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap,4,Sad
His broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight,3,Excite
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville her face as white as his,6,Fear
Broken wrist Harry heard her mutter,4,Sad
Come on boy its all right up you get,2,Love
She turned to the rest of the class,0,Neutral
Ooh sticking up for Longbottom? said Pansy Parkinson a hard-faced Slytherin girl,2,Love
Never thought youd like fat little crybabies Parvati,4,Sad
Look said Malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass,3,Excite
Its that stupid thing Longbottoms gran sent him,2,Love
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up,1,Happy
Give that here Malfoy said Harry quietly,1,Happy
Everyone stopped talking to watch,0,Neutral
Malfoy smiled nastily,1,Happy
I think I will leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find how about up a tree?,3,Excite
Give it here Harry yelled but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off,5,Anger
He had not been lying he could fly well,3,Excite
Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called Come and get it Potter,1,Happy
Harry grabbed his broom,0,Neutral
No shouted Hermione Granger,5,Anger
Madam Hooch told us not to move you will get us all into trouble,5,Anger
Blood was pounding in his ears,5,Anger
He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared,3,Excite
air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he had found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful,1,Happy
He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron,2,Love
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair,3,Excite
Malfoy looked stunned,6,Fear
Give it here Harry called or I will knock you off that broom Oh yeah? said Malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried,5,Anger
He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin,3,Excite
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady,1,Happy
A few people below were clapping,1,Happy
No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck Malfoy Harry called,5,Anger
Catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground,3,Excite
Harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall,6,Fear
He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist,3,Excite
HARRY POTTER,0,Neutral
His heart sank faster than he had just dived,4,Sad
Professor McGonagall was running toward them,3,Excite
He got to his feet trembling,6,Fear
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck,5,Anger
It was not his fault Professor,4,Sad
Be quiet Miss Patil But Malfoy,5,Anger
That is enough Mr Weasley,5,Anger
Harry caught sight of Malfoy Crabbe and Goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in Professor McGonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle,4,Sad
He was going to be expelled he just knew it,6,Fear
He wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice,6,Fear
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up,4,Sad
What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?,3,Excite
Up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still Professor McGonagall did not say a word to him,4,Sad
She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her,5,Anger
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore,3,Excite
He thought of Hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper,4,Sad
His stomach twisted as he imagined it watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrids bag,6,Fear
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom,0,Neutral
She opened the door and poked her head inside,3,Excite
Excuse me Professor Flitwick could I borrow Wood for a moment?,3,Excite
Wood? thought Harry bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused,2,Love
Follow me you two said Professor McGonagall and they marched on up the corridor Wood looking curiously at Harry,3,Excite
In here,0,Neutral
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard,4,Sad
Out Peeves she barked,5,Anger
Peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing,5,Anger
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys,5,Anger
Potter this is Oliver Wood,2,Love
Woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight,1,Happy
Absolutely said Professor McGonagall crisply,2,Love
The boys a natural,2,Love
Was that your first time on a broomstick Potter?,3,Excite
Harry nodded silently,4,Sad
He did not have a clue what was going on but he did not seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs,3,Excite
He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive Professor McGonagall told Wood,3,Excite
Didnt even scratch himself,1,Happy
Charlie Weasley could not have done it,4,Sad
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once,2,Love
Ever seen a game of Quidditch Potter? he asked excitedly,3,Excite
Woods captain of the Gryffindor team Professor McGonagall explained,1,Happy
He is just the build for a Seeker too said Wood now walking around Harry and staring at him,2,Love
Light speedy well have to get him a decent broom Professor a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven Id say,2,Love
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can bend the first-year rule,4,Sad
Heaven knows we need a better team than last year,4,Sad
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin I could not look Severus Snape in the face for weeks,4,Sad
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry,5,Anger
I want to hear you are training hard Potter or I may change my mind about punishing you,5,Anger
Then she suddenly smiled,2,Love
Your father would have been proud she said,2,Love
He was an excellent Quidditch player himself,1,Happy
You are joking,1,Happy
It was dinnertime,0,Neutral
Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he had left the grounds with Professor McGonagall,3,Excite
Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but he had forgotten all about it,4,Sad
You do it then if you are so clever Ron snarled,5,Anger
Seeker? he said,0,Neutral
But first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said Harry shoveling pie into his mouth,2,Love
He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon,1,Happy
Wood told me,0,Neutral
Ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at Harry,2,Love
Only do not tell anyone Wood wants to keep it a secret,4,Sad
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall spotted Harry and hurried over,3,Excite
Well done said George in a low voice,2,Love
Wood told us,0,Neutral
We are on the team too Beaters,1,Happy
I tell you were going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,1,Happy
said Fred,0,Neutral
We have not won since Charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant,1,Happy
You must be good Harry Wood was almost skipping when he told us,3,Excite
Anyway we have got to go Lee Jordan reckons he is found a new secret passageway out of the school,1,Happy
Bet its that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week,1,Happy
See you,0,Neutral
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up Malfoy flanked by Crabbe and Goyle,4,Sad
Having a last meal Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?,4,Sad
You are a lot braver now that you are back on the ground and you have got your little friends with you said Harry coolly,1,Happy
There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle but as the High Table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl,6,Fear
Id take you on anytime on my own said Malfoy,5,Anger
Tonight if you want,0,Neutral
Wizards duel,0,Neutral
Wands only no contact,0,Neutral
Whats the matter? Never heard of a wizards duel before I suppose?,4,Sad
Of course he has said Ron wheeling around,1,Happy
I am his second who is yours?,2,Love
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle sizing them up,1,Happy
Crabbe he said,0,Neutral
Midnight all right? Well meet you in the trophy room; That is always unlocked,3,Excite
When Malfoy had gone Ron and Harry looked at each other,3,Excite
What is a wizards duel? said Harry,3,Excite
And what do you mean you are my second?,2,Love
Well a seconds there to take over if you die said Ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie,6,Fear
Catching the look on Harrys face he added quickly But people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards,6,Fear
The most you and Malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other,4,Sad
Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage,4,Sad
I bet he expected you to refuse anyway,4,Sad
And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?,4,Sad
Throw it away and punch him on the nose Ron suggested,5,Anger
Excuse me,0,Neutral
They both looked up,0,Neutral
It was Hermione Granger,0,Neutral
Cant a person eat in peace in this place? said Ron,5,Anger
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry,4,Sad
I could not help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying,3,Excite
Bet you could Ron muttered,5,Anger
and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points you will lose Gryffindor if you are caught and you are bound to be,6,Fear
And its really none of your business said Harry,5,Anger
Good-bye said Ron,2,Love
All the same it was not what youd call the perfect end to the day Harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep Neville was not back from the hospital wing,4,Sad
Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as If he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because I can not remember how to block them,3,Excite
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris and Harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today,6,Fear
On the other hand Malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face,5,Anger
He could not miss it,0,Neutral
Half-past eleven Ron muttered at last wed better go,3,Excite
They pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor common room,6,Fear
A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows,6,Fear
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them I can not believe you are going to do this Harry,6,Fear
A lamp flickered on,0,Neutral
It was Hermione Granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown,4,Sad
You said Ron furiously,5,Anger
Go back to bed,0,Neutral
I almost told your brother Hermione snapped Percy he is a prefect he had put a stop to this,4,Sad
Harry could not believe anyone could be so interfering,5,Anger
Come on he said to Ron,0,Neutral
He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole,0,Neutral
Hermione was not going to give up that easily,2,Love
She followed Ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose,5,Anger
Do not you care about Gryffindor do you only care about yourselves,4,Sad
I do not want Slytherin to win the house cup and you will lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells,4,Sad
Go away,0,Neutral
All right but I warned you you just remember what I said when you are on the train home tomorrow you are so,5,Anger
But what they were they did not find out,0,Neutral
Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting,6,Fear
The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower,4,Sad
Now what am I going to do? she asked shrilly,6,Fear
That is your problem said Ron,0,Neutral
They had not even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them,3,Excite
I am coming with you she said,2,Love
You are not,0,Neutral
Did you think I am going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?,5,Anger
If he finds all three of us I will tell him the truth that I was trying to stop you and you can back me up,3,Excite
You have got some nerve said Ron loudly,5,Anger
Shut up both of you said Harry sharply,5,Anger
I heard something,0,Neutral
It was a sort of snuffling,0,Neutral
Mrs Norris? breathed Ron squinting through the dark,6,Fear
It was not Mrs Norris,0,Neutral
It was Neville,0,Neutral
He was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer,6,Fear

Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute,1,Happy
Good - well look Neville we have got to be somewhere well see you later,3,Excite
JORDAN,0,Neutral
Sorry Professor,0,Neutral
Do not leave me said Neville scrambling to his feet I do not want to stay here alone the Bloody Barons been past twice already,6,Fear
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville,5,Anger
If either of you get us caught I will never rest until I have learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about and used it on you,5,Anger
Hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward,5,Anger
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows,0,Neutral
At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs Norris but they were lucky,6,Fear
They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room,3,Excite
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them,0,Neutral
Cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness,0,Neutral
They edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room,6,Fear
Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once,6,Fear
He is late maybe he is chickened out Ron whispered,4,Sad
Then a noise in the next room made them jump,6,Fear
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it was not Malfoy,3,Excite
Sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner,2,Love
It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris,1,Happy
Horror struck Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible,6,Fear
they scurried silently toward the door away from Filchs voice,3,Excite
Nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room,3,Excite
They are in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding,3,Excite
This way Harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor,6,Fear
They could hear Filch getting nearer,6,Fear
Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run,6,Fear
he tripped grabbed Ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor,4,Sad
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle,6,Fear
RUN Harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether Filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another,6,Fear
Harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room,1,Happy
I think we have lost him Harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead,3,Excite
Neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering,4,Sad
I told you Hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest I told you,4,Sad
We have got to get back to Gryffindor tower said Ron quickly as possible,3,Excite
You realize that do not you? He was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room Malfoy must have tipped him off,3,Excite
Harry thought she was probably right but he was not going to tell her that,5,Anger
Lets go,0,Neutral
They had not gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them,3,Excite
It was Peeves,0,Neutral
He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight,2,Love
Shut up Peeves please you will get us thrown out,6,Fear
Peeves cackled,1,Happy
Wandering around at midnight Ickle Firsties? Tut tut tut,2,Love
Not if you do not give us away Peeves please,6,Fear
Should tell Filch I should said Peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly,1,Happy
Its for your own good you know,2,Love
Get out of the way snapped Ron taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake,5,Anger
STUDENTS OUT OF BED Peeves bellowed STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR,5,Anger
Ducking under Peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked,4,Sad
This is it Ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door,4,Sad
We are done for This is the end They could hear footsteps Filch running as fast as he could toward Peevess shouts,4,Sad
Oh move over Hermione snarled,5,Anger
She grabbed Harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered Alohomora,3,Excite
The lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening,1,Happy
Quick tell me,0,Neutral
Say please,0,Neutral
Do not mess with me Peeves now where did they go?,5,Anger
Shant say nothing if you do not say please said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice,2,Love
All right please,2,Love
NOTHING Ha haaa Told you I would not say nothing if you did not say please,2,Love
And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage,5,Anger
He thinks this door is locked Harry whispered,1,Happy
I think we will be okay get off Neville For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harrys bathrobe for the last minute,4,Sad
What?,0,Neutral
For a moment he was sure he had walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far,6,Fear
They were in a corridor,0,Neutral
The forbidden corridor on the third floor,6,Fear
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor,6,Fear
It had three heads,6,Fear
Three pairs of rolling mad eyes; three noses twitching and quivering in their direction,6,Fear
It was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and Harry knew that the only reason they were not already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise,3,Excite
but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant,5,Anger
Harry groped for the doorknob between Filch and death he had take Filch,6,Fear
They fell backward Harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor,3,Excite
Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they did not see him anywhere but they hardly cared,3,Excite
all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster,6,Fear
They did not stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor,1,Happy
Where on earth have you all been? she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces,5,Anger
Never mind that pig snout pig snout panted Harry and the portrait swung forward,3,Excite
They scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs,1,Happy
We are not offended said Harry quickly,1,Happy
Neville indeed looked as if he had never speak again,4,Sad
What do they think they are doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? said Ron finally,5,Anger
If any dog needs exercise that one does,2,Love
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again,5,Anger
You do not use your eyes any of you do you? she snapped,5,Anger
Didnt you see what it was standing on,5,Anger
I was not looking at its feet I was too busy with its heads,3,Excite
No not the floor,0,Neutral
She stood up glaring at them,5,Anger
I hope you are pleased with yourselves,2,Love
We could all have been killed or worse expelled,6,Fear
Now if you do not mind I am going to bed,2,Love
No we do not mind he said,2,Love
You would think we dragged her along would not you,3,Excite
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed,3,Excite
The dog was guarding something,0,Neutral
What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps Hogwarts,1,Happy
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was,1,Happy
CHAPTER TEN,0,Neutral
HALLOWEEN,0,Neutral
Malfoy could not believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful,4,Sad
Indeed by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one,3,Excite
In the meantime Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts,1,Happy
and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection,3,Excite
Its either really valuable or really dangerous said Ron,6,Fear
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long,3,Excite
they did not have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues,4,Sad
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor,4,Sad
All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again,6,Fear
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus,2,Love
All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy,5,Anger
and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later,3,Excite
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls,3,Excite
Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,3,Excite
and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor,3,Excite
They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel,1,Happy
Harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE,2,Love
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand,2,Love
but I do not want everybody knowing you have got a broomstick or they will all want one,6,Fear
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session,3,Excite
Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read,2,Love
A Nimbus Two Thousand Ron moaned enviously,2,Love
I have never even touched one,4,Sad
They left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private,3,Excite
before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle,6,Fear
Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it,3,Excite
That is a broomstick he said throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face,5,Anger
You will be in for it this time Potter first years are not allowed them,4,Sad
Its not any old broomstick he said its a Nimbus Two Thousand,3,Excite
What did you say you have got at home Malfoy a Comet Two Sixty? Ron grinned at Harry,1,Happy
Comets look flashy but they are not in the same league as the Nimbus,3,Excite
What would you know about it Weasley you could not afford half the handle Malfoy snapped back,5,Anger
I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig,4,Sad
Before Ron could answer Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoys elbow,6,Fear
Not arguing I hope boys? he squeaked,5,Anger
Potters been sent a broomstick Professor said Malfoy quickly,1,Happy
Yes yes That is right said Professor Flitwick beaming at Harry,2,Love
Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances Potter,2,Love
And what model is it?,3,Excite
A Nimbus Two Thousand sir said Harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoys face,1,Happy
And its really thanks to Malfoy here that I have got it he added,2,Love
Harry and Ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at Malfoys obvious rage and confusion,1,Happy
Well its true Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase,1,Happy
If he had not stolen Nevilles Remembrall I would not be on the team,4,Sad
So I suppose you think That is a reward for breaking rules? came an angry voice from just behind them,5,Anger
Hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in Harrys hand,5,Anger
I thought you were not speaking to us? said Harry,4,Sad
Yes do not stop now said Ron its doing us so much good,2,Love
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air,5,Anger
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day,4,Sad
It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the Quidditch field where he had be learning to play that night,2,Love
He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last,3,Excite
Wow Ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto Harrys bedspread,2,Love
Even Harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful,1,Happy
Sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top,3,Excite
As seven oclock drew nearer Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field,3,Excite
He had never been inside the stadium before,4,Sad
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on,3,Excite
At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end,0,Neutral
They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high,3,Excite
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground,3,Excite
What a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field,1,Happy
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch,3,Excite
Harry you are a great wizard you know,2,Love
Hey Potter come down Oliver Wood had arrived,1,Happy
He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm,0,Neutral
Harry landed next to him,0,Neutral
Very nice said Wood his eyes glinting,2,Love
I see what McGonagall meant you really are a natural,2,Love
I am just going to teach you the rules this evening then you will be joining team practice three times a week,3,Excite
Inside were four different-sized balls,0,Neutral
Right said Wood,0,Neutral
Now Quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play,4,Sad
There are seven players on each side,0,Neutral
Three of them are called Chasers,0,Neutral
Three Chasers Harry repeated as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball,3,Excite
This balls called the Quaffle said Wood,0,Neutral
The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal,3,Excite
Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops,3,Excite
Follow me?,0,Neutral
The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,3,Excite
Harry recited,0,Neutral
So That is sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops is not it?,3,Excite
Now there is another player on each side who is called the Keeper I am Keeper for Gryffindor,3,Excite
I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring,3,Excite
Three Chasers one Keeper said Harry who was determined to remember it all,1,Happy
And they play with the Quaffle,0,Neutral
Okay got that,0,Neutral
So what are they for? He pointed at the three balls left inside the box,3,Excite
Take this,0,Neutral
He handed Harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat,0,Neutral
I am going to show you what the Bludgers do Wood said,3,Excite
These two are the Bludgers,0,Neutral
He showed Harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle,3,Excite
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box,6,Fear
Stand back Wood warned Harry,5,Anger
He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers,3,Excite
At once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harrys face,6,Fear
Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air,5,Anger
it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground,1,Happy
See? Wood panted forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely,1,Happy
The Bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms,3,Excite
That is why you have two Beaters on each team the Weasley twins are ours,3,Excite
its their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team,4,Sad
Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts,3,Excite
the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team Harry reeled off,3,Excite
Very good said Wood,2,Love
Er have the Bludgers ever killed anyone? Harry asked hoping he sounded offhand,6,Fear
We have had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that,6,Fear
Now the last member of the team is the Seeker,3,Excite
That is you,0,Neutral
And you do not have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open,6,Fear
Do not worry the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers I mean they are like a pair of human Bludgers themselves,2,Love
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball,3,Excite
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut,3,Excite
It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings,0,Neutral
This said Wood is the Golden Snitch and its the most important ball of the lot,1,Happy
Its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see,4,Sad
Its the Seekers job to catch it,1,Happy
You have got to weave in and out of the Chasers Beaters Bludgers and Quaffle to get it before the other teams Seeker,5,Anger
because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win,3,Excite
A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught so it can go on for ages,4,Sad
I think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep,3,Excite
Harry shook his head,4,Sad
He understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem,4,Sad
We will not practice with the Snitch you are said Wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it,4,Sad
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and Harry were up in the air,3,Excite
Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch,2,Love
Harry did not miss a single one and Wood was delighted,2,Love
After half an hour night had really fallen and they could not carry on,4,Sad
That Quidditch cup will have our name on it this year said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle,1,Happy
I would not be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley and he could have played for England if he had not gone off chasing dragons,4,Sad
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework,4,Sad
but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he had already been at Hogwarts two months,3,Excite
The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had,2,Love
His lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics,3,Excite
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors,2,Love
Even better Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,2,Love
something they had all been dying to try since they had seen him make Nevilles toad zoom around the classroom,3,Excite
Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice,0,Neutral
Harrys partner was Seamus Finnigan which was a relief because Neville had been trying to catch his eye,6,Fear
Ron however was to be working with Hermione Granger,1,Happy
It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this,5,Anger
She had not spoken to either of them since the day Harrys broomstick had arrived,4,Sad
Now do not forget that nice wrist movement we have been practicing,1,Happy
squeaked Professor Flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual,1,Happy
And saying the magic words properly is very important too,3,Excite
never forget Wizard Baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest,4,Sad
Harry and Seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop,4,Sad
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it Harry had to put it out with his hat,6,Fear
Wingardium Leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill,5,Anger
You are saying it wrong Harry heard Hermione snap,5,Anger
Its Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa make the gar nice and long,0,Neutral
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said Wingardium Leviosa,3,Excite
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads,2,Love
Oh well done cried Professor Flitwick clapping,1,Happy
Everyone see here Miss Grangers done it,1,Happy
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class,5,Anger
Its no wonder no one can stand her he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly,5,Anger
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him,5,Anger
It was Hermione,0,Neutral
Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears,4,Sad
So? said Ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable,4,Sad
She must have noticed shes got no friends,4,Sad
Hermione did not turn up for the next class and was not seen all afternoon,4,Sad
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone,4,Sad
Ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds,3,Excite
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter,6,Fear
The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start-of-term banquet,2,Love
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face,6,Fear
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped Troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know,6,Fear
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint,4,Sad
There was an uproar,6,Fear
It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledores wand to bring silence,5,Anger
Prefects he rumbled lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately,5,Anger
Percy was in his element,1,Happy
Follow me Stick together first years No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders Stay close behind me now,2,Love
Make way first years coming through Excuse me I am a prefect,1,Happy
How could a troll get in? Harry asked as they climbed the stairs,6,Fear
Do not ask me they are supposed to be really stupid said Ron,1,Happy
Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke,1,Happy
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions,1,Happy
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs Harry suddenly grabbed Rons arm,1,Happy
I have just thought Hermione,2,Love
What about her?,3,Excite
Ron bit his lip,4,Sad
Oh all right he snapped,5,Anger
But Percy better not see us,6,Fear
Ducking down they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way,3,Excite
slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom,3,Excite
They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them,6,Fear
Percy hissed Ron pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin,5,Anger
Peering around it however they saw not Percy but Snape,6,Fear
He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view,6,Fear
Whats he doing? Harry whispered,6,Fear
Why is not he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?,6,Fear
Search me,0,Neutral
Quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after Snapes fading footsteps,6,Fear
He is heading for the third floor Harry said but Ron held up his hand,3,Excite
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean,4,Sad
And then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet,5,Anger
Ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them,6,Fear
They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight,6,Fear
It was a horrible sight,6,Fear
Twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut,6,Fear
It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet,0,Neutral
The smell coming from it was incredible,2,Love
It was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long,4,Sad
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside,3,Excite
It waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room,4,Sad
Good idea said Ron nervously,6,Fear
They edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll was not about to come out of it,6,Fear
With one great leap Harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it,3,Excite
Yes,0,Neutral
Flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop,6,Fear
a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they had just chained up,6,Fear
Oh no said Ron pale as the Bloody Baron,6,Fear
Its the girls bathroom Harry gasped,6,Fear
Hermione they said together,2,Love
It was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have?,4,Sad
Wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic,6,Fear
Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside,3,Excite
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint,6,Fear
The troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went,5,Anger
Confuse it Harry said desperately to Ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall,5,Anger
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione,6,Fear
It lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise,3,Excite
It hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went,5,Anger
Oy pea-brain yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it,5,Anger
The troll did not even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder,4,Sad
but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead giving Harry time to run around it,3,Excite
Come on run run Harry yelled at Hermione trying to pull her toward the door,3,Excite
but she could not move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror,6,Fear
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk,5,Anger
It roared again and started toward Ron who was nearest and had no way to escape,5,Anger
The Weasley twins friend Lee Jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by Professor McGonagall,2,Love
Should Harry wake him? Something held him back his fathers cloak,6,Fear
he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone,3,Excite
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid,3,Excite
He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind,3,Excite
The troll could not feel Harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose,3,Excite
and Harrys wand had still been in his hand when he had jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils,5,Anger
Howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with Harry clinging on for dear life,6,Fear
any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club,6,Fear
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright,6,Fear
Ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do,6,Fear
he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head Wingardium Leviosa,5,Anger
The club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head,3,Excite
The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble,6,Fear
He was shaking and out of breath,6,Fear
Ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done,3,Excite
It was Hermione who spoke first,2,Love
Is it dead?,6,Fear
I do not think so said Harry I think its just been knocked out,1,Happy
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose,4,Sad
It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue,4,Sad
He wiped it on the trolls trousers,1,Happy
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up,6,Fear
They had not realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars,3,Excite
A moment later Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by Snape with Quirrell bringing up the rear,5,Anger
Quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart,4,Sad
Snape bent over the troll,0,Neutral
Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry,1,Happy
Harry had never seen her look so angry,5,Anger
Her lips were white,5,Anger
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harrys mind,4,Sad
What on earth were you thinking of? said Professor McGonagall with cold fury in her voice,5,Anger
Harry looked at Ron who was still standing with his wand in the air,3,Excite
You are lucky you were not killed,4,Sad
Why are not you in your dormitory?,5,Anger
Snape gave Harry a swift piercing look,5,Anger
Harry looked at the floor,4,Sad
He wished Ron would put his wand down,4,Sad
Please Professor McGonagall they were looking for me,3,Excite
Miss Granger,0,Neutral
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last,3,Excite
I went looking for the troll because I thought I could deal with it on my own,1,Happy
Hermione Granger telling a downright lie to a teacher?,6,Fear
If they had not found me I would be dead now,4,Sad
Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club,3,Excite
It was about to finish me off when they arrived,6,Fear
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story was not new to them,3,Excite
Well in that case said Professor McGonagall staring at the three of them,5,Anger
Miss Granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?,5,Anger
Hermione hung her head,4,Sad
Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble,3,Excite
It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets,3,Excite
Miss Granger five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this said Professor McGonagall,5,Anger
I am very disappointed in you,4,Sad
If you are not hurt at all you could better get off to Gryffindor tower,2,Love
Students are finishing the feast in their houses,2,Love

Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this,2,Love
You may go,0,Neutral
They hurried out of the chamber and did not speak at all until they had climbed two floors up,4,Sad
It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else,1,Happy
We should have gotten more than ten points Ron grumbled,4,Sad
Five you mean once shes taken off Hermiones,4,Sad
Good of her to get us out of trouble like that Ron admitted,1,Happy
Mind you we did save her,1,Happy
She might not have needed saving if we had not locked the thing in with her Harry reminded him,4,Sad
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady,0,Neutral
Pig snout they said and entered,0,Neutral
The common room was packed and noisy,1,Happy
Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up,3,Excite
Hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them,2,Love
There was a very embarrassed pause,4,Sad
Then none of them looking at each other they all said Thanks and hurried off to get plates,1,Happy
But from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend,2,Love
There are some things you can not share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them,2,Love

If Gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship,1,Happy
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that as their secret weapon Harry should be kept well secret,2,Love
But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow,4,Sad
and Harry did not know which was worse people telling him he had be brilliant,2,Love
or people telling him they would be running around underneath him holding a mattress,4,Sad
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend,2,Love
He did not know how he had have gotten through all his homework without her,4,Sad
with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do,3,Excite
She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages which turned out to be a very interesting read,3,Excite
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473,3,Excite
that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them,4,Sad
that although people rarely died playing Quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert,6,Fear
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it,2,Love
The day before Harrys first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard,6,Fear
during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar,2,Love
They were standing with their backs to it getting warm when Snape crossed the yard,6,Fear
Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping,4,Sad
Harry Ron and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it would not be allowed,6,Fear
Unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught Snapes eye,6,Fear
He had not seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway,5,Anger
It was Quidditch Through the Ages,0,Neutral
Harry showed him,0,Neutral

Harry Ron and Hermione sat together next to a window,1,Happy
Hermione was checking Harry and Rons Charms homework for them,1,Happy
She would never let them copy How will you learn?,4,Sad
but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway,1,Happy
He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow,6,Fear
Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it,5,Anger
Better you than me they said together but Harry had an idea that Snape would not refuse if there were other teachers listening,3,Excite
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked,3,Excite
Nothing,0,Neutral

Harry gulped,6,Fear
I just wondered if I could have my book back,6,Fear
GET OUT OUT,5,Anger
Harry left before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor,6,Fear
In a low whisper Harry told them what he had seen,6,Fear
You know what this means? he finished breathlessly,3,Excite
He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween,3,Excite
That is where he was going when we saw him he is after whatever its guarding,3,Excite
And I bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion,5,Anger
Hermiones eyes were wide,6,Fear
I know he is not very nice but he would not try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe,4,Sad
Honestly Hermione you think all teachers are saints or something,2,Love
snapped Ron,5,Anger
I am with Harry,2,Love
I would not put anything past Snape,5,Anger
But whats he after? Whats that dog guarding?,3,Excite
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question,3,Excite
Neville was snoring loudly but Harry could not sleep,4,Sad

The seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes,4,Sad
Ron and Hermione joined Neville Seamus and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row,0,Neutral
As a surprise for Harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined,2,Love
It said Potter for President and Dean who was good at drawing had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath,2,Love

She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand,3,Excite
Now I want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her,1,Happy
Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint a sixth year,2,Love
Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him,6,Fear
Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing Potter for President over the crowd,2,Love
His heart skipped,6,Fear
He felt braver,1,Happy

Way up above them Harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the Snitch,3,Excite
This was part of his and Woods game plan,1,Happy
Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch Wood had said,3,Excite
We do not want you attacked before you have to be,2,Love
When Angelina had scored Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings,1,Happy
Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch,3,Excite
Once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys wristwatches,4,Sad
and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything,6,Fear
but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it,3,Excite
All right there Harry? he had time to yell as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint,5,Anger
Slytherin in possession Lee Jordan was saying Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers two Weasleys and Chaser Bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the Snitch?,3,Excite
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear,1,Happy
Harry saw it,0,Neutral
In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold,3,Excite
Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch,3,Excite
Harry was faster than Higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead,1,Happy

Down in the stands Dean Thomas was yelling Send him off ref Red card,5,Anger
What are you talking about Dean? said Ron,3,Excite
Red card said Dean furiously,5,Anger
In soccer you get shown the red card and you are out of the game,4,Sad
But this is not soccer Dean Ron reminded him,1,Happy
Hagrid however was on Deans side,2,Love
They oughta change the rules,5,Anger
So after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating Jordan growled Professor McGonagall,5,Anger
I mean after that open and revolting foul Jordan I am warning you,5,Anger
All right all right,0,Neutral
Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker which could happen to anyone,6,Fear
I am sure so a penalty to Gryffindor taken by Spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play Gryffindor still in possession,1,Happy
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened,6,Fear
His broom gave a sudden frightening lurch,6,Fear
For a split second he thought he was going to fall,6,Fear
He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees,6,Fear
It happened again,3,Excite
It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off,5,Anger
But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off,4,Sad
he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control,6,Fear
It was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him,4,Sad
Slytherin in possession Flint with the Quaffle passes Spinnet passes,0,Neutral
Bell hit hard in the face by a Bludger hope it broke his nose only joking Professor Slytherins score A no,5,Anger
The Slytherins were cheering,1,Happy
No one seemed to have noticed that Harrys broom was behaving strangely,4,Sad
It was carrying- him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went,3,Excite
dont know what Harry thinks he is doing Hagrid mumbled,4,Sad
If I did not know better I would say he had lost control of his broom but he can not have,2,Love
Suddenly people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands,3,Excite
His broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on,3,Excite
Then the whole crowd gasped,6,Fear
Harrys broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it,6,Fear
He was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand,6,Fear
Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him? Seamus whispered,3,Excite
Can not have Hagrid said his voice shaking,6,Fear
Can nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand,5,Anger
At these words Hermione seized Hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at Harry she started looking frantically at the crowd,3,Excite
What are you doing? moaned Ron gray-faced,6,Fear
I knew it Hermione gasped Snape look,6,Fear
Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them,0,Neutral
He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath,1,Happy
He is doing something jinxing the broom said Hermione,1,Happy
What should we do?,0,Neutral
Leave it to me,0,Neutral
You can keep it said Harry laughing at how pleased Ron was,2,Love
Hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these?,3,Excite
Before Ron could say another word Hermione had disappeared,4,Sad
His broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer,6,Fear
The whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms,6,Fear
but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still,4,Sad
They dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell,6,Fear
Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing,1,Happy
Come on Hermione Ron muttered desperately,4,Sad
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him.,3,Excite
she did not even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front,4,Sad
Reaching Snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well- chosen words,1,Happy
Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snapes robes,5,Anger
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire,4,Sad
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job,1,Happy
Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row Snape would never know what had happened,1,Happy
Up in the air Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom,1,Happy
Neville had been sobbing into Hagrids jacket for the last five minutes,4,Sad
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick,6,Fear
he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand,3,Excite
I have got the Snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion,1,Happy
He did not catch it he nearly swallowed it Flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference,5,Anger
Harry had not broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results,1,Happy
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty,1,Happy
He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrids hut with Ron and Hermione,2,Love
It was Snape Ron was explaining Hermione and I saw him,5,Anger
He was cursing your broomstick muttering he would not take his eyes off you,5,Anger
Rubbish said Hagrid who had not heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands,4,Sad
Why would Snape do something like that?,6,Fear
Harry Ron and Hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him,6,Fear
Harry decided on the truth,2,Love
I found out something about him he told Hagrid,1,Happy
He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween,6,Fear
We think he was trying to steal whatever its guarding,4,Sad
Hagrid dropped the teapot,6,Fear
How do you know about Fluffy? he said,3,Excite
Fluffy?,0,Neutral
Yeah he is mine bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub last year,2,Love
Now do not ask me anymore said Hagrid gruffly,5,Anger
Rubbish said Hagrid again,5,Anger
Snapes a Hogwarts teacher he had do nothing of the sort,2,Love
So why did he just try and kill Harry? cried Hermione,5,Anger
The afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape,4,Sad
I have read all about them you have got to keep eye contact and Snape was not blinking at all I saw him,1,Happy
I am telling you you are wrong said Hagrid hotly,5,Anger
I do not know why Harrys broom acted like that but Snape wouldn try and kill a student,4,Sad
Now listen to me all three of you you are meddling in things that do not concern you,5,Anger
You forget that dog and you forget what its guarding,5,Anger
That is between Professor Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel,2,Love
Aha said Harry so there is someone called Nicolas Flamel involved is there?,3,Excite
Hagrid looked furious with himself,5,Anger
CHAPTER TWELVE,0,Neutral
THE MIRROR OF ERISED,0,Neutral
Christmas was coming,2,Love
One morning in mid-December Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow,1,Happy
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban,4,Sad
The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again,2,Love
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms,4,Sad
Worst of all were Professor Snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons,1,Happy
I do feel so sorry said Draco Malfoy one Potions class for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they are not wanted at home,4,Sad
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled,1,Happy
Harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them,5,Anger
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match,4,Sad
Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next,4,Sad
Then he had realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick,1,Happy
So Malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family,5,Anger
It was true that Harry was not going back to Privet Drive for Christmas,4,Sad
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and Harry had signed up at once,1,Happy
He did not feel sorry for himself at all.,2,Love
this would probably be the best Christmas he had ever had,2,Love
Ron and his brothers were staying too because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie,2,Love
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead,6,Fear
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it,6,Fear
Hi Hagrid want any help? Ron asked sticking his head through the branches,2,Love
Nah I am all right thanks Ron,2,Love
Would you mind moving out of the way? came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them,3,Excite
Are you trying to earn some extra money Weasley?,3,Excite
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts,1,Happy
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs,5,Anger
I suppose that hut of Hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to,1,Happy
WEASLEY,0,Neutral
Ron let go of the front of Malfoys robes,6,Fear
He was provoked Professor Snape said Hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree,4,Sad
Malfoy was insulting his family,5,Anger
Be that as it may fighting is against Hogwarts rules Hagrid said Snape silkily,4,Sad
Five points from Gryffindor Weasley and be grateful it is not more,1,Happy
Move along all of you,0,Neutral
Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking,1,Happy
I will get him said Ron grinding his teeth at Malfoys back one of these days I will get him,5,Anger
I hate them both said Harry Malfoy and Snape,5,Anger
Come on cheer up its nearly Christmas said Hagrid,2,Love
Tell you what come with me and see the Great Hall looks a treat,3,Excite
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations,2,Love
Ah Hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you?,1,Happy
Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls,1,Happy
and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles,1,Happy
How many days you got left until your holidays? Hagrid asked,3,Excite
Just one said Hermione,0,Neutral
And that reminds me Harry Ron we have got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library,3,Excite
Oh yeah you are right said Ron tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree,1,Happy
The library? said Hagrid following them out of the hall,3,Excite
Just before the holidays? Bit keen are not you?,3,Excite
Oh were not working Harry told him brightly,1,Happy
Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we have been trying to find out who he is,3,Excite
You what? Hagrid looked shocked,6,Fear
Listen here I have told you drop it,5,Anger
Its nothing to you what that dogs guarding,4,Sad
We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is That is all said Hermione,3,Excite
Unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble? Harry added,2,Love
We must have been through hundreds of books already and we can not find him anywhere just give us a hint,4,Sad
I know I have read his name somewhere,3,Excite
Just have to find out for ourselves then said Ron and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library,3,Excite
They had indeed been searching books for Flamels name ever since Hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?,3,Excite
The trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book,4,Sad
He was not in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century or Notable Magical Names of Our Time.,4,Sad
he was missing too from Important Modern Magical Discoveries and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,4,Sad
And then of course there was the sheer size of the library.,3,Excite
tens of thousands of books.,0,Neutral
thousands of shelves.,0,Neutral
hundreds of narrow rows,0,Neutral
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random,3,Excite
Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section,6,Fear
He had been wondering for a while if Flamel was not somewhere in there,4,Sad
Unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he had never get one,4,Sad
These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts,6,Fear
What are you looking for boy?,5,Anger
Nothing said Harry,0,Neutral
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him,6,Fear
You would better get out then,5,Anger
Go on out,5,Anger
Wishing he had been a bit quicker at thinking up some story Harry left the library,4,Sad
He Ron and Hermione had already agreed they had better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel,3,Excite
They were sure shed be able to tell them but they could not risk Snape hearing what they were up to,6,Fear
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he was not very hopeful,4,Sad
They had been looking for two weeks after A but as they only had odd moments between lessons it was not surprising they had found nothing,4,Sad
What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks,3,Excite
Five minutes later Ron and Hermione joined him shaking their heads,4,Sad
You will keep looking while I am away will not you? said Hermione,3,Excite
And send me an owl if you find anything,3,Excite
And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is said Ron,3,Excite
It would be safe to ask them,2,Love
Very safe as they are both dentists said Hermione,2,Love
Once the holidays had started Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel,1,Happy
They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire,1,Happy
They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread English muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they would not work,1,Happy
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess,1,Happy
This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle,3,Excite
Like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather,4,Sad
However old chessmen were not a drawback at all,3,Excite
Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted,2,Love
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him and they did not trust him at all,4,Sad
He was not a very good player you are and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing,5,Anger
Do not send me there can not you see his knight? Send him we can afford to lose him,1,Happy
On Christmas Eve Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all,1,Happy
When he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed,3,Excite
Merry Christmas said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe,2,Love
You too said Harry,1,Happy
Will you look at this? I have got some presents,2,Love
What did you expect turnips? said Ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than Harrys,1,Happy
It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry from Hagrid,2,Love
Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute,1,Happy
Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself,2,Love
Harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl,1,Happy
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present,2,Love
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia,2,Love
That is friendly said Harry,2,Love
I think I know who that ones from said Ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel,2,Love
My mom,2,Love
I told her you did not expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a Weasley sweater,4,Sad
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge,2,Love
Every year she makes us a sweater said Ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroon,2,Love
That is really nice of her said Harry trying the fudge which was very tasty,2,Love
His next present also contained candy a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione,2,Love
Harry picked it up and felt it,1,Happy
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds,3,Excite
Ron gasped,6,Fear
I have heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he had gotten from Hermione,3,Excite
If That is what I think it is they are really rare and really valuable,3,Excite
What is it?,0,Neutral
Harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor,0,Neutral
It was strange to the touch like water woven into material,0,Neutral
Its an invisibility cloak said Ron a look of awe on his face,3,Excite
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell,6,Fear
Harry looked down at his feet but they were gone,6,Fear
Sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible,1,Happy
He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely,1,Happy
A note fell out of it,0,Neutral
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter,3,Excite
Written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words,3,Excite
Your father left this in my possession before he died,2,Love
It is time it was returned to you,1,Happy
Use it well,2,Love
A Very Merry Christmas to you,2,Love
Harry stared at the note,6,Fear
Ron was admiring the cloak,2,Love
Anything,0,Neutral
Whats the matter?,0,Neutral
Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?,6,Fear
Before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in,1,Happy
Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight,6,Fear
Merry Christmas,2,Love
Hey look Harrys got a Weasley sweater too,2,Love
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow F on it the other a G,2,Love
Harrys is better than ours though said Fred holding up Harrys sweater,3,Excite
She obviously makes more of an effort if you are not family,4,Sad
Why are not you wearing yours Ron? George demanded,5,Anger
Come on get it on they are lovely and warm,2,Love
I hate maroon Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head,4,Sad
You have not got a letter on yours George observed,3,Excite
I suppose she thinks you do not forget your name,3,Excite
But were not stupid we know were called Gred and Forge,2,Love
Whats all this noise,5,Anger
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving,5,Anger
He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which Fred seized,2,Love
P for prefect Get it on Percy come on were all wearing ours even Harry got one,2,Love
I do not want said Percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew,5,Anger
And you are not sitting with the prefects today either said George,5,Anger
Christmas is a time for family,2,Love
They frog-marched Percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater,1,Happy
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner,1,Happy
A hundred fat roast turkeys.,1,Happy
platters of chipolatas.,0,Neutral
tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table,0,Neutral
These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside,1,Happy
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it did not just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke,1,Happy
while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice,1,Happy
Up at the High Table Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him,2,Love
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey,2,Love
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice,4,Sad
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,1,Happy
finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek who to Harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided,2,Love
When Harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers,2,Love
The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norriss Christmas dinner,4,Sad
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a snowball fight on the grounds,1,Happy
Then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron,4,Sad
He suspected he would not have lost so badly if Percy had not tried to help him so much,5,Anger
After a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and Christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they had stolen his prefect badge,1,Happy
It had been Harrys best Christmas day ever,2,Love
Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day,6,Fear
Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it,3,Excite
Ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he had drawn the curtains of his four-poster,1,Happy
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it,3,Excite
He let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air,1,Happy
Use it well the note had said,0,Neutral
He had to try it now,0,Neutral
He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself,0,Neutral
Looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows,3,Excite
It was a very funny feeling,1,Happy
Use it well,0,Neutral
The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak,3,Excite
Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence,3,Excite
He could go anywhere in this anywhere and Filch would never know,1,Happy
He crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole,1,Happy
Whos there? squawked the Fat Lady,5,Anger
Harry said nothing,0,Neutral
Where should he go? He stopped his heart racing and thought,6,Fear
And then it came to him,1,Happy
The Restricted Section in the library,6,Fear
He would be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who Flamel was,3,Excite
He set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked,3,Excite
The library was pitch-black and very eerie,6,Fear
Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books,0,Neutral
The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps,6,Fear
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library,0,Neutral
Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles,1,Happy
Their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry could not understand,4,Sad
Some had no title at all,4,Sad
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood,6,Fear
The hairs on the back of Harrys neck prickled,6,Fear
Maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who should not be,6,Fear
Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book,3,Excite
A large black and silver volume caught his eye,3,Excite
He pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open,0,Neutral
A piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming,6,Fear
Harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note,5,Anger
He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once,6,Fear
Panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it,6,Fear
He passed Filch in the doorway.,6,Fear
Filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and Harry slipped under Filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his ears,6,Fear
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor,3,Excite
He had been so busy getting away from the library he had not paid attention to where he was going,6,Fear
Perhaps because it was dark he did not recognize where he was at all,6,Fear
There was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there,3,Excite
You asked me to come directly to you Professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library Restricted Section,1,Happy
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face,6,Fear
Wherever he was Filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was Snape who replied,6,Fear
The Restricted Section? Well they can not be far well catch them,3,Excite
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead,6,Fear
They could not see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they had knock right into him the cloak did not stop him from being solid,4,Sad
He backed away as quietly as he could,6,Fear
A door stood ajar to his left,1,Happy
It was his only hope,2,Love
He squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything,1,Happy
They walked straight past and Harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away,1,Happy
That had been close very close,1,Happy
It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in,3,Excite
It looked like an unused classroom,6,Fear
The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket,6,Fear
but propped against the wall facing him was something that did not look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way,3,Excite
It was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet,0,Neutral
There was an inscription carved around the top Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi,1,Happy
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape Harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again,4,Sad
He stepped in front of it,0,Neutral
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming,6,Fear
He whirled around,6,Fear
His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him,6,Fear
But the room was empty,6,Fear
Breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror,6,Fear
There he was reflected in it white and scared-looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others,6,Fear
Harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there,6,Fear
Or were they all invisible too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again,3,Excite
A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving,2,Love
He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him,4,Sad
If she was really there he had touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror,4,Sad
She was a very pretty woman,2,Love
She had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine Harry thought edging a little closer to the glass,2,Love
Bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying.,4,Sad
smiling but crying at the same time,2,Love
The tall thin black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her,2,Love
He wore glasses and his hair was very untidy,0,Neutral
It stuck up at the back just as Harrys did,0,Neutral
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection,3,Excite
Mom? he whispered,2,Love
Dad?,2,Love
They just looked at him smiling,2,Love
And slowly Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and Harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life,2,Love
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them,2,Love
He had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness,4,Sad
How long he stood there he did not know,4,Sad
The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses,3,Excite
He could not stay here he had to find his way back to bed,4,Sad
He tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered I will come back,4,Sad
You could have woken me up said Ron crossly,5,Anger
You can come tonight I am going back I want to show you the mirror,3,Excite
I would like to see your mom and dad Ron said eagerly,3,Excite
And I want to see all your family all the Weasleys you will be able to show me your other brothers and everyone,2,Love
You can see them any old time said Ron,1,Happy
Just come round my house this summer,1,Happy
Anyway maybe it only shows dead people,4,Sad
Have some bacon or something why are not you eating anything?,2,Love
Harry could not eat,4,Sad
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight,3,Excite
Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it really? Are you all right? said Ron,5,Anger
You look odd,6,Fear
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again,4,Sad
With Ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night,4,Sad
They tried retracing Harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour,6,Fear
I am freezing said Ron,4,Sad
No Harry hissed,5,Anger
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else,4,Sad
just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold Harry spotted the suit of armor,3,Excite
Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror,3,Excite
His mother and father beamed at the sight of him,2,Love
Look Look at them all there are loads of them,1,Happy
I can only see you,2,Love
Look in it properly go on stand where I am,3,Excite
Harry stepped aside but with Ron in front of the mirror he could not see his family anymore just Ron in his paisley pajamas,4,Sad
Ron though was staring transfixed at his image,1,Happy
Look at me he said,3,Excite
Can you see all your family standing around you?,2,Love
No I am alone but I am different I look older and I am head boy,1,Happy
What?,0,Neutral
I am wearing the badge like Bill used to and I am holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup I am Quidditch captain too,1,Happy
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry,3,Excite
Do you think this mirror shows the future?,3,Excite
How can it? All my family are dead let me have another look,4,Sad
You had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time,3,Excite
You are only holding the Quidditch cup whats interesting about that? I want to see my parents,5,Anger
Do not push me,5,Anger
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion,4,Sad
They had not realized how loudly they had been talking,6,Fear
Quick,0,Neutral
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door,6,Fear
Ron and Harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age she turned and left,1,Happy
This is not safe she might have gone for Filch I bet she heard us,6,Fear
Come on,0,Neutral
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room,5,Anger
The snow still had not melted the next morning,1,Happy
Want to play chess Harry? said Ron,2,Love
No,0,Neutral
Why do not we go down and visit Hagrid?,2,Love
No you go,0,Neutral
I know what you are thinking about Harry that mirror,4,Sad
Do not go back tonight,5,Anger
Why not?,0,Neutral
I do not know I have just got a bad feeling about it and anyway you have had too many close shaves already,4,Sad
Filch Snape and Mrs Norris are wandering around,6,Fear
So what if they can not see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?,6,Fear
You sound like Hermione,5,Anger
I am serious Harry do not go,5,Anger
But Harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and Ron was not going to stop him,3,Excite
That third night he found his way more quickly than before,1,Happy
He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he did not meet anyone,3,Excite
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily,2,Love
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror,4,Sad
There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family,1,Happy
Nothing at all,0,Neutral
Except So back again Harry?,2,Love
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice,6,Fear
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore,1,Happy
Harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he had not noticed him,6,Fear
Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said Dumbledore and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling,2,Love
So said Dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised,2,Love
But I expect you have realized by now what it does?,3,Excite
It well it shows me my family,2,Love
And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy,3,Excite
I do not need a cloak to become invisible said Dumbledore gently,1,Happy
Now can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?,3,Excite
Harry shook his head,4,Sad
Let me explain,0,Neutral
The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is,2,Love
Does that help?,0,Neutral
Harry thought,0,Neutral
Then he said slowly It shows us what we want,1,Happy
It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts,2,Love
You who have never known your family see them standing around you,2,Love
Ronald Weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them,2,Love
However this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth,4,Sad
Men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible,4,Sad
The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow Harry and I ask you not to go looking for it again,4,Sad
If you ever do run across it you will now be prepared,2,Love
It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that,4,Sad
Now why do not you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?,2,Love
Sir Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?,3,Excite
Obviously you have just done so Dumbledore smiled,2,Love
You may ask me one more thing however,1,Happy
What do you see when you look in the mirror?,3,Excite
I? I see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks,2,Love
Harry stared,5,Anger
One can never have enough socks said Dumbledore,4,Sad
Another Christmas has come and gone and I did not get a single pair,2,Love
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful,4,Sad
But then he thought as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question,6,Fear
CHAPTER THIRTEEN,0,Neutral
NICOLAS FLAMEL,0,Neutral
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk,4,Sad
Harry wished he could forget what he had seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt,4,Sad
He started having nightmares,6,Fear
Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter,6,Fear
You see Dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said Ron when Harry told him about these drearns,5,Anger
Hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things,1,Happy
She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row,6,Fear
If Filch had caught you and disappointment that he had not at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was,4,Sad
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book even though Harry was still sure he had read the name somewhere,4,Sad
Once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks,3,Excite
Harry had even less time than the other two because Quidditch practice had started again,3,Excite
Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow could not dampen his spirits,1,Happy
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic but Harry was on Woods side,5,Anger
If they won their next match against Hufflepuff they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years,3,Excite
Quite apart from wanting to win Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training,1,Happy
Then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session Wood gave the team a bit of bad news,4,Sad
He had just gotten very angry with the Weasleys who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms,5,Anger
Will you stop messing around he yelled,5,Anger
That is exactly the sort of thing that will lose us the match Snapes refereeing this time and he will be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor,5,Anger
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words,6,Fear
Snapes refereeing? he spluttered through a mouthful of mud,6,Fear
Whens he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He is not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin,5,Anger
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain too,5,Anger
We have just got to make sure we play a clean game so Snape has not got an excuse to pick on us,3,Excite
Which was all very well thought Harry but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch,4,Sad
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess,3,Excite
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her,1,Happy
Do not talk to me for a moment said Ron when Harry sat down next to him I need to concen He caught sight of Harrys face,5,Anger
Whats the matter with you? You look terrible,4,Sad
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear Harry told the other two about Snapes sudden sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee,4,Sad
Do not play said Hermione at once,5,Anger
Really break your leg said Ron,5,Anger
If I back out Gryffindor can not play at all,4,Sad
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room,3,Excite
How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse,3,Excite
He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower,3,Excite
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse,1,Happy
Nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling,6,Fear
What happened? Hermione asked him leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron,2,Love
Malfoy said Neville shakily,5,Anger
He said he had been looking for someone to practice that on,3,Excite
Go to Professor McGonagall Hermione urged Neville,3,Excite
Report him,5,Anger
Neville shook his head,4,Sad
I do not want more trouble he mumbled,6,Fear
You have got to stand up to him Neville said Ron,2,Love
He is used to walking all over people but That is no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier,4,Sad
Theres no need to tell me I am not brave enough to be in Gryffindor Malfoys already done that Neville choked out,4,Sad
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas,3,Excite
He gave it to Neville who looked as though he might cry,4,Sad
You are worth twelve of Malfoy Harry said,2,Love
The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor did not it? And wheres Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin,2,Love
Nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog,2,Love
Thanks Harry I think I will go to bed,1,Happy
Dyou want the card you collect them do not you?,2,Love
As Neville walked away Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card,3,Excite
Dumbledore again he said He was the first one I ever-,1,Happy
He gasped,6,Fear
He stared at the back of the card,6,Fear
Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione,6,Fear
I have found him he whispered,1,Happy
I have found Flamel I told you I had read the name somewhere before,3,Excite
I read it on the train coming here listen to this,1,Happy
Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel,0,Neutral
She had not looked so excited since they had gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework,1,Happy
Stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories,3,Excite
Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms,1,Happy
I never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly,3,Excite
I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading,3,Excite
Light? said Ron but Hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself,3,Excite
I knew it I knew it,1,Happy
Are we allowed to speak yet? said Ron grumpily,5,Anger
Nicolas Flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the Sorcerers Stone,3,Excite
She pushed the book toward them and Harry and Ron read The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerers Stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers,3,Excite
The stone will transform any metal into pure gold,3,Excite
It also produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal,2,Love
There have been many reports of the Sorcerers Stone over the centuries but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover,3,Excite
Mr Flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife Perenelle six hundred and fifty-eight,2,Love
See? said Hermione when Harry and Ron had finished,3,Excite
The dog must be guarding Flamels Sorcerers Stone,3,Excite
I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they are friends and he knew someone was after it,2,Love
That is why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts,0,Neutral
A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said Harry,3,Excite
No wonder Snapes after it Anyone would want it,1,Happy
And no wonder we could not find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry said Ron,4,Sad
He is not exactly recent if he is six hundred and sixty-five is he?,3,Excite
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites Harry and Ron were still discussing what they had do with a Sorcerers Stone if they had one,3,Excite
It was not until Ron said he had buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match,6,Fear
If I do not all the Slytherins will think I am just too scared to face Snape,5,Anger
I will show them it will really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win,5,Anger
Just as long as we are not wiping you off the field said Hermione,4,Sad
As the match drew nearer however Harry became more and more nervous whatever he told Ron and Hermione,6,Fear
The rest of the team was not too calm either,6,Fear
The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful,1,Happy
no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee?,4,Sad
Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went,6,Fear
At times he even wondered whether Snape was following him trying to catch him on his own,6,Fear
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture Snape was so horrible to Harry,4,Sad
Could Snape possibly know they had found out about the Sorcerers Stone?,6,Fear
Harry did not see how he could you are he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds,6,Fear
Harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they had ever see him alive again,2,Love
This was not what you would call comforting,4,Sad
Harry hardly heard a word of Woods pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand,6,Fear
Ron and Hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to Neville who could not understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match,3,Excite
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse,3,Excite
They had gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry,5,Anger
Now do not forget its Locomotor Mortis Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve,1,Happy
I know Ron snapped,5,Anger
Do not nag,5,Anger
Back in the locker room Wood had taken Harry aside,3,Excite
Do not want to pressure you Potter but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch its now,1,Happy
Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much,3,Excite
The whole schools out there said Fred Weasley peering out of the door,3,Excite
Even blimey Dumbledores come to watch,3,Excite
Harrys heart did a somersault,1,Happy
Dumbledore? he said dashing to the door to make sure,1,Happy
Fred was right,1,Happy
There was no mistaking that silver beard,2,Love
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe,2,Love
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching,1,Happy
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that Ron noticed too,5,Anger
I have never seen Snape look so mean he told Hermione,5,Anger
Look -theyre off Ouch,0,Neutral
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head,5,Anger
It was Malfoy,0,Neutral
Oh sorry Weasley did not see you there,4,Sad
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle,1,Happy
Wonder how long Potters going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you Weasley?,3,Excite
Ron did not answer.,0,Neutral
Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him,4,Sad
Hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at Harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the Snitch,3,Excite
You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team? said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all,1,Happy
Its people they feel sorry for,4,Sad

Hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet,3,Excite
You are in luck Weasley Potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said Malfoy,2,Love
Ron snapped,5,Anger
Before Malfoy knew what was happening Ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground,5,Anger
Neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help,1,Happy
Come on Harry Hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape,3,Excite
she did not even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville Crabbe and Goyle,5,Anger
Up in the air Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches,6,Fear
the next second Harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the Snitch clasped in his hand,1,Happy
The stands erupted.,1,Happy

Gryffindor in the lead,0,Neutral
He had done it he had shown Snape,1,Happy
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle,6,Fear
Clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest,6,Fear
Harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched,3,Excite
He recognized the figures prowling walk,1,Happy
Snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on?,3,Excite
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off,3,Excite
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run,3,Excite
The trees were so thick he could not see where Snape had gone,4,Sad
He flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices,1,Happy
He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree,3,Excite
He climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves,6,Fear
Below in a shadowy clearing stood Snape but he was not alone,6,Fear
Quirrell was there too,0,Neutral
Harry could not make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever,6,Fear
Harry strained to catch what they were saying,3,Excite

Students are not supposed to know about the Sorcerers Stone after all,1,Happy
Quirrell was mumbling something,6,Fear
Snape interrupted him,5,Anger

But Severus I,0,Neutral
You do not want me as your enemy Quirrell said Snape taking a step toward him,5,Anger
I do not know what you You know perfectly well what I mean,5,Anger
An owl hooted loudly and Harry nearly fell out of the tree,6,Fear
He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say your little bit of hocus-pocus,1,Happy
Very well Snape cut in,5,Anger
We will have another little chat soon when you have had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie,3,Excite
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing,1,Happy
It was almost dark now but Harry could see Quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified,6,Fear
Harry where have you been? Hermione squeaked,2,Love
We won You won We won shouted Ron thumping Harry on the back,2,Love
And I gave Malfoy a black eye and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed,5,Anger

Everyones waiting for you in the common room we are having a party Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens,2,Love
Never mind that now said Harry breathlessly,6,Fear
Lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this,3,Excite
He made sure Peeves was not inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he had seen and heard,1,Happy
So we were right it is the Sorcerers Stone and Snapes trying to force Quirrell to help him get it,3,Excite
He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy and he said something about Quirrells hocus pocuss,3,Excite
I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy loads of enchantments probably and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through,1,Happy
So you mean the Stones only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape? said Hermione in alarm,6,Fear
It will be gone by next Tuesday said Ron,4,Sad

NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK,0,Neutral
Quirrell however must have been braver than they had thought,2,Love
In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it did not look as though he had cracked yet,6,Fear
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor Harry Ron and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside,3,Excite
Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the Stone was still safe,4,Sad
Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrells stutter,2,Love
Hermione however had more on her mind than the Sorcerers Stone,1,Happy
She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes,3,Excite

Unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione,4,Sad
They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays were not nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones,4,Sad
It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements,4,Sad
Moaning and yawning Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work,4,Sad

It was the first really fine day they had had in months,1,Happy
The sky was a clear forget-me-not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming,2,Love

They will think I have told you,5,Anger
See you later then said Harry,1,Happy
Hagrid shuffled off,4,Sad
What was he hiding behind his back? said Hermione thoughtfully,6,Fear
Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?,6,Fear

Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks Convention of 1709 everyone knows that,6,Fear
Its hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway you can not tame dragons its dangerous,6,Fear

When they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed,3,Excite
Hagrid called Who is it? before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them,6,Fear
It was stifling hot inside,6,Fear
Even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate,6,Fear
Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused,2,Love

There was no point beating around the bush,5,Anger
We were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the Sorcerers Stone apart from Fluffy,3,Excite
Hagrid frowned at him,5,Anger

Number two you know too much already so I would not tell you if I could,5,Anger
That Stone is here for a good reason,1,Happy
It Was almost stolen out of Gringotts - I suppose you have worked that out and all? Beats me how you even know about Fluffy,3,Excite
Oh come on Hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said Hermione in a warm flattering voice,2,Love
Hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling,2,Love
We only wondered who had done the guarding really,3,Excite
We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you,1,Happy
Hagrids chest swelled at these last words,2,Love
Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione,2,Love
Well I do not suppose it could hurt to tell you that lets see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some of the teachers did enchantments,3,Excite

Hang on I have forgotten someone,6,Fear
Snape?,0,Neutral
Yeah you are not still on about that are you? Look Snape helped protect the Stone he is not about to steal it,5,Anger
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was,3,Excite
If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it,1,Happy
He probably knew everything except it seemed Quirrells spell and how to get past Fluffy,4,Sad
You are the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy,1,Happy

And you would not tell anyone would you? Not even one of the teachers?,6,Fear

Well I have been doing some reading said Hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow,1,Happy

So now they had something else to worry about what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut,4,Sad
Wonder what its like to have a peaceful life Ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting,4,Sad
Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron too,2,Love
It was driving them nuts,5,Anger

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut,3,Excite
Hermione would not hear of it,5,Anger
Hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?,2,Love
We have got lessons we will get into trouble and That is nothing to what Hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what he is doing,6,Fear
Shut up Harry whispered,5,Anger
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen,6,Fear
How much had he heard? Harry did not like the look on Malfoys face at all,6,Fear
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrids with the other two during morning break,5,Anger
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest,3,Excite

All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open,3,Excite
The baby dragon flopped onto the table,2,Love

Whats the matter?,0,Neutral
Someone was looking through the gap in the curtains its a kid he is running back up to the school,6,Fear
Even at a distance there was no mistaking him,4,Sad
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoys face during the next week made Harry Ron and Hermione very nervous,6,Fear
They spent most of their free time in Hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him,2,Love
Just let him go Harry urged,5,Anger
Set him free,0,Neutral
I can not said Hagrid,0,Neutral
He is too little,0,Neutral

He had been down at Hagrids hut helping him feed Norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate,2,Love
It bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief,4,Sad
I am not going to be able to hold a quill for a week,4,Sad
I tell you that dragons the most horrible animal I have ever met but the way Hagrid goes on about it you would think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit,5,Anger

The three of them put their heads together to read the note,3,Excite
Dear Ron,0,Neutral
How are you? Thanks for the letter I would be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback but it will not be easy getting him here,2,Love

Love,2,Love
Charlie,0,Neutral
We have got the invisibility cloak said Harry,0,Neutral

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him,4,Sad
Anything to get rid of Norbert and Malfoy,5,Anger
There was a hitch,0,Neutral
By the next morning Rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size,4,Sad
He did not know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon though he had no choice,6,Fear
The cut had turned a nasty shade of green,4,Sad
It looked as if Norberts fangs were poisonous,6,Fear
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed,4,Sad
Its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off,6,Fear
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me,4,Sad
He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me I have told her it was a dog but I do not think she believes me,6,Fear
I should not have hit him at the Quidditch match That is why he is doing this,4,Sad
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down,2,Love
It will all be over at midnight on Saturday said Hermione but this did not soothe Ron at all,4,Sad
On the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat,6,Fear
Midnight on Saturday he said in a hoarse voice,6,Fear
Oh no oh no I have just remembered Charlies letter was in that book Malfoy took he is going to know were getting rid of Norbert,6,Fear
Harry and Hermione did not get a chance to answer,4,Sad
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying Ron needed sleep,2,Love
Its too late to change the plan now Harry told Hermione,1,Happy
We have not got time to send Charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert,4,Sad
Well have to risk it,5,Anger
And we have got the invisibility cloak Malfoy does not know about that,1,Happy
I am not as good as you said Harry very embarrassed as she let go of him,2,Love
They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid who opened a window to talk to them,3,Excite
I will not let you in he puffed,5,Anger
Norberts at a tricky stage nothing I can not handle,6,Fear
When they told him about Charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg,4,Sad
Aargh Its all right he only got my boot just playing he is only a baby after all,2,Love
The baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle,2,Love
Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday could not come quickly enough,4,Sad
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they had not been so worried about what they had to do,4,Sad
It was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrids hut,4,Sad
because they had had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he had been playing tennis against the wall,4,Sad
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate,3,Excite
He is got lots of rats and some brandy for the journey said Hagrid in a muffled voice,4,Sad
And I have packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely,2,Love
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off,6,Fear
Bye-bye Norbert Hagrid sobbed as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves,4,Sad
Mommy will never forget you,2,Love
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew,1,Happy
Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors,6,Fear
UP another staircase then another even one of Harrys shortcuts did not make the work much easier,4,Sad
Nearly there Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower,3,Excite
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate,6,Fear
Forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away,3,Excite
A lamp flared,0,Neutral
Professor McGonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had Malfoy by the ear,5,Anger
Detention she shouted,5,Anger
And twenty points from Slytherin Wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you,5,Anger
Harry Potters coming he is got a dragon,3,Excite
What utter rubbish How dare you tell such lies Come on I shall see Professor Snape about you Malfoy,5,Anger
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that,2,Love
Not until they had stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again,1,Happy
Hermione did a sort of jig,6,Fear
Malfoys got detention I could sing,2,Love
Do not Harry advised her,2,Love
Chuckling about Malfoy they waited Norbert thrashing about in his crate,3,Excite
About ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness,6,Fear
Charlies friends were a cheery lot,1,Happy
They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they had rigged up so they could suspend Norbert between them,1,Happy
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much,2,Love
They slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that Norbert was off them,1,Happy
No more dragon Malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs,4,Sad
As they stepped into the corridor Filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darkness,6,Fear
Well well well he whispered we are in trouble,5,Anger

CHAPTER FIFTEEN,0,Neutral
THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST,0,Neutral
Things could not have been worse,4,Sad
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other,6,Fear
Hermione was trembling,6,Fear
Excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around Harrys brain each more feeble than the last,6,Fear
He could not see how they were going to get out of trouble this time,4,Sad
They were cornered,4,Sad
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?,5,Anger
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night,4,Sad
let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out-of-bounds except for classes,3,Excite
Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as we will be packing their bags already,4,Sad
Had Harry thought that things could not have been worse? He was wrong,6,Fear
When Professor McGonagall appeared she was leading Neville,3,Excite
Harry Neville burst Out the moment he saw the other two,2,Love
I was trying to find you to warn you I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag,3,Excite
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up but Professor McGonagall had seen,4,Sad
She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them,5,Anger
I would never have believed it of any of you,5,Anger
Explain yourselves,5,Anger
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question,4,Sad
She was staring at her slippers as still as a statue,6,Fear
I think I have got a good idea of whats been going on said Professor McGonagall,3,Excite
It does not take a genius to work it out,1,Happy
You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble,4,Sad
I suppose you think its funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it too?,5,Anger
Harry caught Nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this was not true because Neville was looking stunned and hurt,4,Sad
Poor blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them,2,Love
I am disgusted said Professor McGonagall,5,Anger
Four students out of bed in one night I have never heard of such a thing before You Miss Granger I thought you had more sense,5,Anger
As for you Mr Potter I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this,4,Sad
All three of you will receive detentions yes you too Mr Longbottom,5,Anger
nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor,5,Anger
Fifty? Harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he had won in the last Quidditch match,6,Fear
Fifty points each said Professor McGonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose,5,Anger
Do not tell me what I can and can not do Potter,5,Anger
Now get back to bed all of you,2,Love
I have never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students,4,Sad
Yeah said Hagrid glancing up too,3,Excite
Listen I am glad we have run into you Ronan cause there is a unicorn beenn hurt you seen anything?,3,Excite
In one night they had ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup,4,Sad
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach,4,Sad
How could they ever make up for this? Harry did not sleep all night,4,Sad
He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours,4,Sad
Harry could not think of anything to say to comfort him,4,Sad
He knew Neville like himself was dreading the dawn,4,Sad
What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they had done?,6,Fear
At first Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake,5,Anger
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?,3,Excite
And then the story started to spread Harry Potter the famous Harry Potter,1,Happy
their hero of two Quidditch matches had lost them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years,5,Anger
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school Harry was suddenly the most hated,5,Anger
Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup,5,Anger
Everywhere Harry went people pointed and did not trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him,5,Anger
Slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering Thanks Potter we owe you one,2,Love
Only Ron stood by him,2,Love
They will all forget this in a few weeks,4,Sad
Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they have been here and people still like them,2,Love
They have never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they? said Harry miserably,4,Sad
Well no Ron admitted,0,Neutral
It was a bit late to repair the damage but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that were not his business from now on,5,Anger
He had had it with sneaking around and spying,5,Anger
He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team,4,Sad
Resign? Wood thundered,5,Anger
What good will that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can not win at Quidditch?,5,Anger
The rest of the team would not speak to Harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the Seeker,2,Love
Hermione and Neville were suffering too,4,Sad
They did not have as bad a time as Harry because they were not as well-known but nobody would speak to them either,4,Sad
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence,4,Sad
Harry was almost glad that the exams were not far away,1,Happy
He Ron and Hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions,3,Excite
learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions,3,Excite
Then about a week before the exams were due to start Harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that did not concern him was put to an unexpected test,6,Fear
Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead,4,Sad
No no not again please,0,Neutral
It sounded as though someone was threatening him,5,Anger
All right all right he heard Quirrell sob,4,Sad
Next second Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban,3,Excite
He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry,6,Fear
He waited until Quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom,3,Excite
It was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end,0,Neutral
Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he had promised himself about not meddling,5,Anger
All the same he had have gambled twelve Sorcerers Stones that Snape had just left the room,3,Excite
and from what Harry had just heard Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last,4,Sad
Harry went back to the library where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy,1,Happy
Snapes done it then said Ron,1,Happy
Theres still Fluffy though said Hermione,2,Love
Maybe Snapes found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,3,Excite
said Ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them,3,Excite
I bet there is a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog,3,Excite
So what do we do Harry?,0,Neutral
The light of adventure was kindling again in Rons eyes but Hermione answered before Harry could,3,Excite
That is what we should have done ages ago,1,Happy
If we try anything ourselves we will be thrown out for sure,6,Fear
But we have got no proof said Harry,4,Sad
Quirrells too scared to back us up,4,Sad
Snapes only got to say he does not know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they will believe him or us?,3,Excite
Its not exactly a secret we hate him Dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked,3,Excite
Filch would not help us if his life depended on it he is too friendly with Snape and the more students get thrown out the better he will think,1,Happy
And do not forget we are not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy,5,Anger
Hermione looked convinced but Ron did not,4,Sad
No said Harry flatly we have done enough poking around,5,Anger
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons,3,Excite
The following morning notes were delivered to Harry Hermione and Neville at the breakfast table,3,Excite
They were all the same Your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight,5,Anger
Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they had lost,4,Sad
He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she did not say a word,4,Sad
Like Harry she felt they deserved what they had got,4,Sad
At eleven oclock that night they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville,3,Excite
Filch was already there and so was Malfoy,1,Happy
Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention too,4,Sad
Follow me said Filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside,1,Happy
I bet you will think twice about breaking a school rule again will not you eh? he said leering at them,5,Anger
Oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me,5,Anger
Its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days,4,Sad
I have got the chains still in my office keep them well oiled in case they are ever needed,3,Excite
Right off we go and do not think of running off now it will be worse for you if you do,5,Anger
They marched off across the dark grounds,6,Fear
Neville kept sniffing,6,Fear
Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be,3,Excite
It must be something really horrible or Filch would not be sounding so delighted,6,Fear
Ronan did not answer immediately,5,Anger
He stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again,4,Sad
The moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness,6,Fear
Ahead Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrids hut,3,Excite
Harrys heart rose.,2,Love
if they were going to be working with Hagrid it would not be so bad,1,Happy
His relief must have showed in his face because Filch said I suppose you think you will be enjoying yourself with that oaf?,2,Love
Well think again boy its into the forest you are going and I am much mistaken if you will all come out in one piece,6,Fear
At this Neville let out a little moan and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks,6,Fear
The forest? he repeated and he did not sound quite as cool as usual,6,Fear
We can not go in there at night there is all sorts of things in there werewolves I heard,6,Fear
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harrys robe and made a choking noise,6,Fear
That is your problem is not it? said Filch his voice cracking with glee,1,Happy
Should have thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble should not you?,5,Anger
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark Fang at his heel,3,Excite
He was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder,5,Anger
All right Harry Hermione?,2,Love
I should not be too friendly to them Hagrid said Filch coldly they are here to be punished after all,5,Anger
That is why you are late is it? said Hagrid frowning at Filch,5,Anger
Been lecturing them? It is not your place to do that,5,Anger
I will be back at dawn said Filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness,5,Anger
I am not going in that forest he said and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice,1,Happy
you are if you want to stay at Hogwarts said Hagrid fiercely,5,Anger
you have done wrong and now you have got to pay for it,5,Anger
But this is servant stuff its not for students to do,5,Anger
I thought we would be copying lines or something if my father knew I was doing this he would tell your That is how it is at Hogwarts Hagrid growled,5,Anger
Copying lines What goods that to anyone? you will do something useful or you will get out,3,Excite
If you think your father had rather you were expelled then get back off to the castle and pack,5,Anger
Go on Malfoy did not move,6,Fear
He looked at Hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze,5,Anger
Right then said Hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what we are gonna do tonight and I do not want no one taking risks,2,Love
Holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees,6,Fear
A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest,1,Happy
Look there said Hagrid see that stuff shining on the ground? Silvery stuff? That is unicorn blood,3,Excite
Theres a unicorn in there been hurt badly by something,4,Sad
I found one dead last Wednesday,4,Sad
We are gonna try and find the poor thing,2,Love
We might have to put it out of its misery,2,Love
And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first? said Malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice,6,Fear
Theres nothing that lives in the forest that will hurt you if your with me or Fang said Hagrid,2,Love
And keep to the path,0,Neutral
Right now were gonna split inter two parties and follow the trail in diffrent directions,3,Excite
Theres blood all over the place it must have been staggering around since last night at least,4,Sad
I want Fang said Malfoy quickly looking at Fangs long teeth,3,Excite
So me Harry and Hermionell go one way and Draco Neville and Fangll go the other,3,Excite
Now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right? Get your wands out and practice now,3,Excite
That is it and if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks and well all come and find you so be careful lets go,4,Sad
The forest was black and silent,6,Fear
A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and Harry Hermione and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy Neville and Fang took the right,1,Happy
They walked in silence their eyes on the ground,6,Fear
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves,1,Happy
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried,4,Sad
Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns? Harry asked,3,Excite
Not fast enough said Hagrid,4,Sad
Its not easy to catch a unicorn they are powerful magic creatures,3,Excite
I never knew one to be hurt before,2,Love
They walked past a mossy tree stump,0,Neutral
Harry could hear running water.,0,Neutral
There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path,0,Neutral
Do not worry it cant have gone far if its this badly hurt and then we will be able to GET BEHIND THAT TREE,4,Sad
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak,1,Happy
He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire,5,Anger
Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground,6,Fear
Hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away,1,Happy
Theres something in here that should not be,4,Sad
That wasn no werewolf and it was no unicorn neither said Hagrid grimly,4,Sad
Right follow me but careful now,2,Love
They walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound,6,Fear
Whos there? Hagrid called,0,Neutral
Show yourself I am armed,5,Anger
And into the clearing came was it a man or a horse?,3,Excite
To the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail,0,Neutral
Oh its you Ronan said Hagrid in relief,1,Happy
How are you?,0,Neutral
He walked forward and shook the centaurs hand,2,Love
Good evening to you Hagrid said Ronan,2,Love
He had a deep sorrowful voice,0,Neutral
We are you going to shoot me?,6,Fear
Cant be too careful Ronan said Hagrid patting his crossbow,1,Happy
Theres something bad loose in this forest,6,Fear
This is Harry Potter and Hermione Granger by the way,2,Love
Students up at the school,0,Neutral
and this is Ronan you two,0,Neutral
He is a centaur,0,Neutral
We had noticed said Hermione faintly,6,Fear
Good evening said Ronan,2,Love
Students are you? And do you learn much up at the school?,3,Excite
Erm,0,Neutral
A bit said Hermione timidly,4,Sad
A bit,0,Neutral
Ronan sighed,0,Neutral
He flung back his head and stared at the sky,4,Sad
Mars is bright tonight,0,Neutral
Always the innocent are the first victims he said,4,Sad
Yeah said Hagrid but have you seen anything Ronan? Anything unusual?,3,Excite
Mars is bright tonight Ronan repeated while Hagrid watched him impatiently,2,Love
Unusually bright,0,Neutral
Yeah but I was meaning anything unusual a bit nearer home said Hagrid,6,Fear
So you have not noticed anything strange?,3,Excite
Yet again Ronan took a while to answer,0,Neutral
At last he said The forest hides many secrets,6,Fear
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur black-haired and bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan,6,Fear
Hello Bane said Hagrid,2,Love
All right?,0,Neutral
Good evening Hagrid I hope you are well?,2,Love
Well enough,0,Neutral
Look I have just been asking Ronan you seen anything odd in here lately?,3,Excite
there is a unicorn been injured would you know anything about it?,5,Anger
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan,2,Love
He looked skyward,0,Neutral
Mars is bright tonight he said simply,2,Love
We have heard said Hagrid grumpily,5,Anger
Well if either of you do see anything let me know will not you? we will be off then,1,Happy
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view,3,Excite
Never said Hagrid irritably try and get a straight answer out of a centaur,5,Anger
Ruddy stargazers,0,Neutral
Not interested in anything closer than the moon,4,Sad
Are there many of them in here? asked Hermione,3,Excite
Oh a fair few Keep themselves to themselves mostly but they are good enough about turning up if ever I want a word,2,Love
They are deep mind centaurs they know things just do not let on much,4,Sad
Do you think that was a centaur we heard earlier? said Harry,3,Excite
Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah if you ask me that was whats been killing the unicorns never heard anything like it before,6,Fear
They walked on through the dense dark trees,6,Fear
Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder,6,Fear
He had the nasty feeling they were being watched,6,Fear
He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them,1,Happy
They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrids arm,2,Love
Hagrid Look Red sparks the others are in trouble,3,Excite
You two wait here Hagrid shouted,5,Anger
Stay on the path I will come back for you,2,Love
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they could not hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them,6,Fear
You do not think they have been hurt do you? whispered Hermione,4,Sad
I do not care if Malfoy has but if somethings got Neville its our fault he is here in the first place,4,Sad
The minutes dragged by,0,Neutral
Harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig,3,Excite
What was going on? Where were the others? At last a great crunching noise announced Hagrids return,1,Happy
Malfoy Neville and Fang were with him,2,Love
Hagrid was fuming,5,Anger
Malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke,1,Happy
Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks,6,Fear
We will be lucky to catch anything now with the racket you two were making,5,Anger
Right were changing groups Neville you stay with me and Hermione Harry you go with Fang and this idiot,5,Anger
I am sorry Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry but he will have a harder time frightening you and we have got to get this done,4,Sad
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang,1,Happy
They walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick,6,Fear
Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker,6,Fear
There were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by,4,Sad
Harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak,3,Excite
Look he murmured holding out his arm to stop Malfoy,3,Excite
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground,3,Excite
They inched closer,0,Neutral
It was the unicorn all right and it was dead,4,Sad
Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad,4,Sad
Its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves,2,Love
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood,6,Fear
A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered,3,Excite
Then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast,6,Fear
Harry Malfoy and Fang stood transfixed,6,Fear
The cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood,6,Fear
AAAAAAAAAARGH,0,Neutral
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did Fang,6,Fear
The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front,6,Fear
It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry he could not move for fear,6,Fear
Then a pain like he had never felt before pierced his head.,4,Sad
Half blinded he staggered backward,6,Fear
He heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over Harry charging at the figure,3,Excite
The pain in Harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees,4,Sad
It took a minute or two to pass,0,Neutral
A centaur was standing over him not Ronan or Bane.,3,Excite
this one looked younger.,0,Neutral
he had white-blond hair and a palomino body,0,Neutral
Are you all right? said the centaur pulling Harry to his feet,2,Love
He had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires,2,Love
He looked carefully at Harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on Harrys forehead,3,Excite
You are the Potter boy he said,0,Neutral
You had better get back to Hagrid,0,Neutral
The forest is not safe at this time especially for you,4,Sad
My name is Firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back,2,Love
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing,3,Excite
Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty,3,Excite
Firenze Bane thundered,5,Anger
What are you doing? You have a human on your back Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?,5,Anger
What have you been telling him? growled Bane,5,Anger
Remember Firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens,4,Sad
Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?,3,Excite
Ronan pawed the ground nervously,4,Sad
I am sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice,4,Sad
Bane kicked his back legs in anger,5,Anger
Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic Potter,2,Love
For the best What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest,5,Anger
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on,5,Anger
Do you not see that unicorn? Firenze bellowed at Bane,5,Anger
Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret?,5,Anger
I set myself against what is lurking in this forest Bane yes with humans alongside me if I must,2,Love
And Firenze whisked around.,6,Fear
with Harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving Ronan and Bane behind them,4,Sad
Harry did not have a clue what was going on,6,Fear
Whys Bane so angry? he asked,5,Anger
What was that thing you saved me from anyway?,3,Excite
Firenze slowed to a walk warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches but did not answer Harrys question,4,Sad
They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze did not want to talk to him anymore,4,Sad
They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when Firenze suddenly stopped,6,Fear
Harry Potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for?,3,Excite
No said Harry startled by the odd question,6,Fear
We have only used the horn and tail hair in Potions,0,Neutral
That is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said Firenze,5,Anger
Only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime,5,Anger
The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price,4,Sad
You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half-life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips,6,Fear
Harry stared at the back of Firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlight,6,Fear
But who would be that desperate? he wondered aloud,3,Excite
If you are going to be cursed forever deaths better is not it?,4,Sad
It is Firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else,3,Excite
something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die,1,Happy
Mr Potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?,3,Excite
The Sorcerers Stone Of course the Elixir of Life But I do not understand who,6,Fear
Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance?,3,Excite
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harrys heart,6,Fear
Over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met Some say he died,4,Sad
Codswallop in my opinion,0,Neutral
dont know if he had enough human left in him to die,4,Sad
Do you mean Harry croaked that was Vol-,6,Fear
Harry Harry are you all right?,2,Love
Hermione was running toward them down the path Hagrid puffing along behind her,3,Excite
I am fine said Harry hardly knowing what he was saying,1,Happy
The unicorns dead Hagrid its in that clearing back there,4,Sad
This is where I leave you Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn,4,Sad
You are safe now,1,Happy
Harry slid off his back,0,Neutral
Good luck Harry Potter said Firenze,2,Love
The planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs,4,Sad
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving Harry shivering behind him,6,Fear
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return,2,Love
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake,1,Happy
In a matter of seconds though he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest,3,Excite
He was still shaking,6,Fear
Snape wants the stone for Voldemort and Voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich,3,Excite
Stop saying the name said Ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought Voldemort could hear them,6,Fear
Firenze saved me but he should not have done so,4,Sad
Bane was furious,5,Anger
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen,3,Excite
They must show that Voldemorts coming back,1,Happy
Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me,4,Sad
I suppose That is written in the stars as well,3,Excite
Will you stop saying the name Ron hissed,5,Anger
So all I have got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,3,Excite
Harry went on feverishly then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off Well I suppose Bane will be happy,1,Happy
Hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort,6,Fear
Harry everyone says Dumbledores the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around You-Know-Who will not touch you,2,Love
Anyway who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me and Professor McGonagall says That is a very imprecise branch of magic,5,Anger
They went to bed exhausted their throats sore,4,Sad
When Harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them,2,Love
CHAPTER SIXTEEN,0,Neutral
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR,0,Neutral
In years to come Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams,6,Fear
when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment,6,Fear
Yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door,2,Love
It was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers,0,Neutral
They had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell,4,Sad
Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk,2,Love
Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers,3,Excite
Snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion,6,Fear
Harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest,4,Sad
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry could not sleep,4,Sad
but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it,6,Fear
Look said Harry throwing caution to the winds Professor its about the Sorcerers tone,3,Excite
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected it was not that,4,Sad
The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she did not pick them up,6,Fear
How do you know? she spluttered,3,Excite
Maybe it was because they had not seen what Harry had seen in the forest,4,Sad
or because they did not have scars burning on their foreheads but Ron and Hermione did not seem as worried about the Stone as Harry,4,Sad
The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them but he did not keep visiting them in dreams,6,Fear
and they were so busy with their studying they did not have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to,4,Sad
Their very last exam was History of Magic,0,Neutral
One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who had invented selfstirring cauldrons,0,Neutral
they would be free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out,1,Happy
When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment Harry could not help cheering with the rest,1,Happy
That was far easier than I thought it would be said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds,1,Happy
I need not have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager,3,Excite
Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but Ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree,4,Sad
The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows,2,Love
No more studying Ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass,1,Happy
You could look more cheerful Harry we have got a week before we find out how badly we have done there is no need to worry yet,1,Happy
Harry was rubbing his forehead,0,Neutral
I wish I knew what this means he burst out angrily,5,Anger
My scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as this,4,Sad
Go to Madam Pomfrey Hermione suggested,1,Happy
I am not ill said Harry,0,Neutral
I think its a warning it means dangers coming,6,Fear
Harry relax Hermiones right the Stones safe as long as Dumbledores around,1,Happy
Anyway we have never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy,4,Sad
He nearly had his leg ripped off once he is not going to try it again in a hurry,6,Fear
And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down,2,Love
Harry nodded but he could not shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he had forgotten to do something important,6,Fear
When he tried to explain this Hermione said That is just the exams,3,Excite
I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we had done that one,1,Happy
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling did not have anything to do with work though,6,Fear
He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth,3,Excite
Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters,2,Love
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but Harry suddenly jumped to his feet,3,Excite
Wherere you going? said Ron sleepily,0,Neutral
I have just thought of something said Harry,0,Neutral
He had turned white,6,Fear
Why? panted Hermione hurrying to keep up,6,Fear
Do not you think its a bit odd said Harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?,2,Love
How many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid do not you think? Why did not I see it before?,2,Love
What are you talking about? said Ron but Harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest did not answer,3,Excite
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house.,1,Happy
his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl,0,Neutral
Hello he said smiling,1,Happy
Finished your exams? Got time for a drink?,2,Love
Yes please said Ron but Harry cut him off,5,Anger
You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?,3,Excite
dont know said Hagrid casually he would not take his cloak off,4,Sad
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows,6,Fear
Its not that unusual you get a lot of funny folk in the Hogs Head That is the pub down in the village,1,Happy
Might have been a dragon dealer might not he? I never saw his face he kept his hood up,3,Excite
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas,4,Sad
Might have come up said Hagrid frowning as he tried to remember,5,Anger
Yeah he asked what I did and I told him I was gamekeeper here,0,Neutral
He asked a bit about the sort of creatures I took after,2,Love
so I told him and I said what I had always really wanted was a dragon and then I can remember too well cause he kept buying me drinks,2,Love
Lets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg and we could play cards for it if I wanted but he had to be sure I could handle it he did not want it to go to any old home,2,Love
So I told him after Fluffy a dragon would be easy,1,Happy
And did he did he seem interested in Fluffy? Harry asked trying to keep his voice calm,3,Excite
Well yeah how many three-headed dogs do you meet even around Hogwarts?,3,Excite
So I told him Fluffys a piece of cake if you know how to calm him down just play him a bit of music and he will go straight off to sleep,2,Love
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified,6,Fear
Forget I said it Hey where are you going?,3,Excite
Harry Ron and Hermione did not speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds,6,Fear
We have got to go to Dumbledore said Harry,1,Happy
Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak it must have been easy once he had got Hagrid drunk,1,Happy
Firenze might back us up if Bane does not stop him,3,Excite
Wheres Dumbledores office?,0,Neutral
They looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction,3,Excite
They had never been told where Dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him,4,Sad
We will just have to Harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall,6,Fear
What are you three doing inside?,3,Excite
It was Professor McGonagall carrying a large pile of books,0,Neutral
We want to see Professor Dumbledore said Hermione rather bravely Harry and Ron thought,3,Excite
See Professor Dumbledore? Professor McGonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do,5,Anger
Why?,0,Neutral
Harry swallowed now what? Its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he had not because Professor McGonagalls nostrils flared,5,Anger
Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly,5,Anger
He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once,3,Excite
He is gone? said Harry frantically,6,Fear
Now?,0,Neutral
Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard Potter he has many demands on his time But this is important,2,Love
Professor I think I know that someones going to try and steal the Stone,3,Excite
I have got to talk to Professor Dumbledore,1,Happy
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion,6,Fear
Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally,3,Excite
I do not know how you found out about the Stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protected,1,Happy
But Professor,0,Neutral
Potter I know what I am talking about she said shortly,5,Anger
She bent down and gathered up the fallen books,0,Neutral
I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine,2,Love
But they didnt,0,Neutral
Its tonight said Harry once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot,3,Excite
Snapes going through the trapdoor tonight,1,Happy
He is found out everything he needs and now he is got Dumbledore out of the way,2,Love
He sent that note I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up,6,Fear
But what can we,0,Neutral
Hermione gasped,6,Fear
Snape was standing there,0,Neutral
Good afternoon he said smoothly,2,Love
They stared at him,6,Fear
You should not be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile,1,Happy
We were Harry began without any idea what he was going to say,6,Fear
You want to be more careful said Snape,2,Love
Hanging around like this people will think you are up to something,4,Sad
And Gryffindor really can not afford to lose any more points can it?,4,Sad
Harry flushed,4,Sad
They turned to go outside but Snape called them back,1,Happy
Be warned Potter any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled,5,Anger
Good day to you,2,Love
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom,5,Anger
Out on the stone steps Harry turned to the others,0,Neutral
Right here is what we have got to do he whispered urgently,3,Excite
One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it,1,Happy
Hermione you could better do that,2,Love
Why me?,6,Fear
Its obvious said Ron,0,Neutral
You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick you know,0,Neutral
He put on a high voice Oh Professor Flitwick I am so worried I think I got question fourteen b wrong,4,Sad
Oh shut up said Hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape,1,Happy
And we should better stay outside the third-floor corridor Harry told Ron,1,Happy
Come on,0,Neutral
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper,5,Anger
I suppose you think you are harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed,5,Anger
Enough of this nonsense If I hear you have come anywhere near here again I will take another fifty points from Gryffindor,5,Anger
Yes Weasley from my own house Harry and Ron went back to the common room,4,Sad
Harry had just said At least Hermiones on Snapes tail when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in,2,Love
I am sorry Harry she wailed,4,Sad
Snape came out and asked me what I was doing so I said I was waiting for Flitwick and Snape went to get him and I have only just got away I do not know where Snape went,4,Sad
Well That is it then is not it? Harry said,4,Sad
The other two stared at him,0,Neutral
He was pale and his eyes were glittering,6,Fear
I am going out of here tonight and I am going to try and get to the Stone first,3,Excite
You are mad said Ron,5,Anger
You can not said Hermione,5,Anger
After what McGonagall and Snape have said? you will be expelled,5,Anger
SO WHAT Harry shouted,5,Anger
Do not you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone Voldemorts coming back have not you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?,5,Anger
There will not be any Hogwarts to get expelled from He will flatten it or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts Losing points does not matter anymore can not you see?,4,Sad
Do you think he will leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup?,4,Sad
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone well I will have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there,3,Excite
its only dying a bit later than I would have because I am never going over to the Dark Side,5,Anger
I am going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me Voldemort killed my parents remember?,4,Sad
He glared at them,5,Anger
You are right Harry said Hermione in a small voice,4,Sad
Its just lucky I got it back,2,Love
All all three of us?,6,Fear
Oh come off it you do not think we would let you go alone?,2,Love
Of course not said Hermione briskly,5,Anger
How do you think you would get to the Stone without us? I should better go and took through my books there might be something useful,2,Love
But if we get caught you two will be expelled too,4,Sad
Not if I can help it said Hermione grimly,4,Sad
Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam,1,Happy
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room,6,Fear
none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more after all,4,Sad
This was the first night he had not been upset by it,1,Happy
Hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break,3,Excite
Harry and Ron did not talk much,5,Anger
Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do,1,Happy
Slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed,2,Love
Better get the cloak Ron muttered as Lee Jordan finally left stretching and yawning,2,Love
Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory,6,Fear
He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas,2,Love
He pocketed it to use on Fluffy he did not feel much like singing,4,Sad
We should better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own,6,Fear
What are you doing? said a voice from the corner of the room,3,Excite
Neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching Trevor the toad who looked as though he had been making another bid for freedom,2,Love
Nothing Neville nothing said Harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back,6,Fear
Neville stared at their guilty faces,5,Anger
No no no said Hermione,6,Fear
Why do not you go to bed Neville?,2,Love
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door,0,Neutral
They could not afford to waste any more time Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep,2,Love
You can not go out said Neville you will be caught again,4,Sad
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble,6,Fear
You do not understand said Harry this is important,3,Excite
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate,1,Happy
I will not let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole,5,Anger
I will I will fight you,5,Anger
Neville Ron exploded get away from that hole and do not be an idiot,5,Anger
Do not you call me an idiot said Neville,4,Sad
I do not think you should be breaking any more rules And you were the one who told me to stand up to people,2,Love
Yes but not to us said Ron in exasperation,5,Anger
Neville you do not know what you are doing,4,Sad
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad who leapt out of sight,4,Sad
Go on then try and hit me said Neville raising his fists,5,Anger
Harry turned to Hermione,0,Neutral
Do something he said desperately,2,Love
Hermione stepped forward,0,Neutral
Neville she said I am really really sorry about this,4,Sad
She raised her wand,0,Neutral
Petrificus Totalus she cried pointing it at Neville,5,Anger
Nevilles arms snapped to his sides,6,Fear
His legs sprang together,0,Neutral
His whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board,6,Fear
Hermione ran to turn him over,0,Neutral
Nevilles jaws were jammed together so he could not speak,4,Sad
Only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror,6,Fear
What have you done to him? Harry whispered,6,Fear
Its the full Body-Bind said Hermione miserably,4,Sad
Oh Neville I am so sorry,2,Love
We had to Neville no time to explain said Harry,4,Sad
You will understand later Neville said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak,3,Excite
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor did not feel like a very good omen,6,Fear
In their nervous state every statues shadow looked like Filch every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them,6,Fear
At the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top,1,Happy
Oh lets kick her just this once Ron whispered in Harrys ear but Harry shook his head,4,Sad
As they climbed carefully around her Mrs Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but did not do anything,4,Sad
They did not meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor,4,Sad
Peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip,5,Anger
Whos there? he said suddenly as they climbed toward him,6,Fear
He narrowed his wicked black eyes,5,Anger
Know you are there even if I can not see you,3,Excite
Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?,2,Love
He rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them,5,Anger
Should call Filch I should if somethings a-creeping around unseen,6,Fear
Peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible,5,Anger
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock,6,Fear
He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs,1,Happy
So sorry your bloodiness Mr Baron Sir he said greasily,4,Sad
My mistake my mistake I did not see you of course I did not you are invisible forgive old Peevsie his little joke sir,4,Sad
Stay away from this place tonight,5,Anger
I will sir I most certainly will said Peeves rising up in the air again,2,Love
Hope your business goes well Baron I will not bother you,2,Love
And he scooted off Brilliant Harry whispered Ron,2,Love
A few seconds later they were there outside the third-floor corridor and the door was already ajar,6,Fear
Well there you are Harry said quietly Snapes already got past Fluffy,2,Love
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them,3,Excite
Underneath the cloak Harry turned to the other two,3,Excite
If you want to go back I will not blame you he said,1,Happy
You can take the cloak I will not need it now,2,Love
Do not be stupid said Ron,5,Anger
We are coming said Hermione,2,Love
Harry pushed the door open,3,Excite
As the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears,5,Anger
All three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it could not see them,3,Excite
It must wake up the moment you stop playing said Harry,6,Fear
Well here goes,0,Neutral
He put Hagrids flute to his lips and blew,1,Happy
It was not really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop,2,Love
Harry hardly drew breath,0,Neutral
Slowly the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep,2,Love
Keep playing Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor,2,Love
They could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads,6,Fear
I think we will be able to pull the door open said Ron peering over the dogs back,3,Excite
Want to go first Hermione?,0,Neutral
No I dont,0,Neutral
All right,0,Neutral
Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs,6,Fear
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open,1,Happy
What can you see? Hermione said anxiously,3,Excite
Nothing just black there is no way of climbing down well just have to drop,6,Fear
Harry who was still playing the flute waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself,1,Happy
You want to go first? Are you sure? said Ron,6,Fear
I do not know how deep this thing goes,6,Fear
Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep,2,Love
Harry handed the flute over,0,Neutral
In the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment Hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep,5,Anger
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor,3,Excite
There was no sign of the bottom,0,Neutral
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips,6,Fear
Then he looked up at Ron and said If anything happens to me do not follow,6,Fear
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore right?,3,Excite
Right said Ron,0,Neutral
See you in a minute I hope,2,Love
Cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and FLUMP,6,Fear
With a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft,1,Happy
He sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom,3,Excite
It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant,0,Neutral
Its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump,1,Happy
Ron followed right away,0,Neutral
He landed sprawled next to Harry,0,Neutral
dont know some sort of plant thing,0,Neutral
Come on Hermione,0,Neutral
There was a loud bark from the dog but Hermione had already jumped,5,Anger
She landed on Harrys other side,0,Neutral
We must be miles under the school she said,6,Fear
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall,2,Love
She had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles,6,Fear
As for Harry and Ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing,6,Fear
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her,1,Happy
Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them,6,Fear
Stop moving Hermione ordered them,5,Anger
Oh I am so glad we know what its called That is a great help snarled Ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck,5,Anger
Shut up I am trying to remember how to kill it said Hermione,5,Anger
Well hurry up I can not breathe Harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest,6,Fear
Devils Snare Devils Snare what did Professor Sprout say? it likes the dark and the damp So light a fire Harry choked,1,Happy
Yes of course but there is no wood Hermione cried wringing her hands,4,Sad
HAVE YOU GONE MAD? Ron bellowed,5,Anger
ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?,5,Anger
Oh right said Hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant,1,Happy
In a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth,1,Happy
Wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free,1,Happy
Lucky you pay attention in Herbology Hermione said Harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face,1,Happy
Yeah said Ron and lucky Harry does not lose his head in a crisis there is no wood honestly,5,Anger
This way said Harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward,3,Excite
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls,0,Neutral
The passageway sloped downward and Harry was reminded of Gringotts,1,Happy
With an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank,6,Fear
If they met a dragon a fully-grown dragon Norbert had been bad enough,6,Fear
Harry listened,0,Neutral
A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead,0,Neutral
Do you think its a ghost?,6,Fear
I do not know sounds like wings to me,0,Neutral
Theres light ahead I can see something moving,3,Excite
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them,1,Happy
It was full of small jewel-bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room,3,Excite
On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door,0,Neutral
Do you think they will attack us if we cross the room? said Ron,6,Fear
Probably said Harry,0,Neutral
They do not look very vicious but I suppose if they all swooped down at once well there is no other choice I will run,6,Fear
He took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room,6,Fear
He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened,6,Fear
He pulled the handle but it was locked,4,Sad
The other two followed him,0,Neutral
They tugged and heaved at the door but it would not budge not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm,4,Sad
These birds they can not be here just for decoration said Hermione,3,Excite
They watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering? They are not birds Harry said suddenly,3,Excite
They are keys Winged keys look carefully,3,Excite
So that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys,1,Happy
yes look Broomsticks We have got to catch the key to the door,3,Excite
But there are hundreds of them,2,Love
Ron examined the lock on the door,0,Neutral
We are looking for a big old-fashioned one probably silver like the handle,0,Neutral
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys,3,Excite
They grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one,4,Sad
Not for nothing though was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century,1,Happy
He had a knack for spotting things other people didnt,1,Happy
After a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole,4,Sad
That big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side,4,Sad
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom,4,Sad
We have got to close in on it Harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing,1,Happy
Ron you come at it from above Hermione stay below and stop it from going down and I will try and catch it,3,Excite
Right NOW,0,Neutral
Ron dived Hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and Harry streaked after it.,3,Excite
it sped toward the wall Harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand,1,Happy
Ron and Hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber,1,Happy
They landed quickly and Harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand,3,Excite
He rammed it into the lock and turned it worked,5,Anger
The moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice,4,Sad
Ready? Harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle,3,Excite
They nodded,0,Neutral
The next chamber was so dark they could not see anything at all,6,Fear
But as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight,1,Happy
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone,3,Excite
Facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces,0,Neutral
Harry Ron and Hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces,6,Fear
Now what do we do? Harry whispered,3,Excite
Its obvious is not it? said Ron,0,Neutral
We have got to play our way across the room,3,Excite
Behind the white pieces they could see another door,3,Excite
How? said Hermione nervously,6,Fear
I think said Ron were going to have to be chessmen,1,Happy
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse,1,Happy
At once the stone sprang to life,2,Love
The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron,2,Love
Do we er have to join you to get across? The black knight nodded,1,Happy
Ron turned to the other two,0,Neutral
This needs thinking about he said,0,Neutral
I suppose we have got to take the place of three of the black pieces,4,Sad
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet watching Ron think,4,Sad
Finally he said Now do not be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess,2,Love
Well Harry you take the place of that bishop and Hermione you next to him instead of that castle,1,Happy
What about you?,0,Neutral
I am going to be a knight said Ron,3,Excite
The chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that Harry Ron and Hermione took,1,Happy
White always plays first in chess said Ron peering across the board,0,Neutral
Yes look,0,Neutral
A white pawn had moved forward two squares,3,Excite
Ron started to direct the black pieces,3,Excite
They moved silently wherever he sent them,4,Sad
Harrys knees were trembling,6,Fear
What if they lost? Harry move diagonally four squares to the right,6,Fear
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken,6,Fear
The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown,6,Fear
Had to let that happen said Ron looking shaken,6,Fear
Every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy,5,Anger
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall,4,Sad
Twice Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger,6,Fear
He himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones,5,Anger
We are nearly there he muttered suddenly,3,Excite
Let me think let me think,5,Anger
The white queen turned her blank face toward him,6,Fear
Yes said Ron softly Its the only way I have got to be taken,4,Sad
NO Harry and Hermione shouted,5,Anger
That is chess snapped Ron,5,Anger
You have got to make some sacrifices I take one step forward and she will take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king Harry,3,Excite
But,0,Neutral
Ron,0,Neutral
Look if you do not hurry up he will already have the Stone,6,Fear
There was no alternative,4,Sad
Ready? Ron called his face pale but determined,6,Fear
Here I go now do not hang around once you have won,2,Love
He stepped forward and the white queen pounced,6,Fear
She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor,5,Anger
Hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged Ron to one side,4,Sad
He looked as if he had been knocked out,4,Sad
Shaking Harry moved three spaces to the left,6,Fear
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harrys feet,4,Sad
They had won,1,Happy
The chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear,2,Love
With one last desperate look back at Ron Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway,3,Excite
What if hes?,0,Neutral
He will be all right said Harry trying to convince himself,4,Sad
We have had Sprouts that was the Devils Snare.,0,Neutral
Flitwick must have put charms on the keys.,0,Neutral
McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive.,0,Neutral
that leaves Quirrells spell and Snapes,0,Neutral
All right? Harry whispered,2,Love
Go on,0,Neutral
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses,6,Fear
Eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head,6,Fear
I am glad we did not have to fight that one Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs,1,Happy
Come on I can not breathe,0,Neutral
He pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next,3,Excite
but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line,0,Neutral
Snapes said Harry,0,Neutral
What do we have to do?,0,Neutral
They stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway,6,Fear
It was not ordinary fire either.,6,Fear
it was purple,0,Neutral
At the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward,6,Fear
Look Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles,3,Excite
Harry looked over her shoulder to read it Danger lies before you while safety lies behind Two of us will help you which ever you would find,1,Happy
One among us seven will let you move ahead Another will transport the drinker back instead Two among our number hold only nettle wine Three of us are killers waiting bidden in line,6,Fear
Choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore To help you in your choice we give you these clues four First however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wines left side.,5,Anger
Second different are those who stand at either end But if you would move onward neither is your friend.,6,Fear
Third as you see clearly all are different size Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides.,4,Sad
Fourth the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them though different at first sight,2,Love
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing,1,Happy
Brilliant said Hermione,2,Love
A lot of the greatest wizards have not got an ounce of logic they had be stuck in here forever,4,Sad
But so will we will not we? Of course not said Hermione,1,Happy
Everything we need is here on this paper,3,Excite
Seven bottles three are poison.,6,Fear
two are wine.,2,Love
one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple,1,Happy
But how do we know which to drink?,6,Fear
Give me a minute,0,Neutral
Hermione read the paper several times,0,Neutral
Then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them,3,Excite
At last she clapped her hands,2,Love
Got it she said,1,Happy
The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the Stone,3,Excite
That is hardly one swallow,6,Fear
They looked at each other,2,Love
Which one will get you back through the purple flames?,3,Excite
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line,3,Excite
You drink that said Harry,2,Love
No listen get back and get Ron,0,Neutral
Grab brooms from the flying key room they will get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore we need him,1,Happy
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while but I am no match for him really,4,Sad
But Harry what if You-Know-Whos with him?,6,Fear
Well I was lucky once was not I? said Harry pointing at his scar,2,Love
I might get lucky again,2,Love
Hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him,2,Love
Hermione,0,Neutral
Me said Hermione,0,Neutral
Books And cleverness There are more important things friendship and bravery and oh Harry be careful,2,Love
You drink first said Harry,2,Love
You are sure which is which are not you?,6,Fear
Positive said Hermione,1,Happy
She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered,6,Fear
Its not poison? said Harry anxiously,6,Fear
No but its like ice,0,Neutral
Good luck take care,2,Love
GO,0,Neutral
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire,3,Excite
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle,3,Excite
He turned to face the black flames,6,Fear
Here I come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp,3,Excite
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body,6,Fear
He put the bottle down and walked forward.,1,Happy
he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but could not feel them for a moment,6,Fear
he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber,3,Excite
There was already someone there but it was not Snape,4,Sad
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN,0,Neutral
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES It was Quirrell,0,Neutral
You gasped Harry,6,Fear
Quirrell smiled,1,Happy
Me he said calmly,1,Happy
I wondered whether I would be meeting you here Potter,2,Love
But I thought Snape,6,Fear
Severus? Quirrell laughed and it was not his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp,2,Love
Yes Severus does seem the type does not he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat,2,Love
Next to him who would suspect poor stuttering Professor Quirrell?,4,Sad
Harry could not take it in,6,Fear
This could not be true it couldnt,6,Fear
No no no,0,Neutral
I tried to kill you,5,Anger
Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match,5,Anger
Another few seconds and I could have got you off that broom,3,Excite
I would have managed it before then if Snape had not been muttering a countercurse trying to save you,2,Love
Of course said Quirrell coolly,1,Happy
Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I did not do it again,5,Anger
Funny really he need not have bothered,1,Happy
I could not do anything with Dumbledore watching,4,Sad
All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular,4,Sad
and what a waste of time when after all that I am going to kill you tonight,5,Anger
Quirrell snapped his fingers,5,Anger
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry,6,Fear
You are too nosy to live Potter,5,Anger
Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that for all I knew you had seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone,3,Excite
You let the troll in?,6,Fear
I have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?,1,Happy
Unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it,4,Sad
Snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog did not even manage to bite Snapes leg off properly,5,Anger
I need to examine this interesting mirror,3,Excite
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell,0,Neutral
It was the Mirror of Erised,0,Neutral
This mirror is the key to finding the Stone Quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame,1,Happy
Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this but he is in London I will be far away by the time he gets back,1,Happy
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror,1,Happy
I saw you and Snape in the forest he blurted out,3,Excite
Yes said Quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back,0,Neutral
He was on to me by that time trying to find out how far I had got,3,Excite
He suspected me all along,5,Anger
Tried to frighten me - as though he could when I had Lord Voldemort on my side,6,Fear
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it,5,Anger
I see the Stone I am presenting it to my master but where is it?,3,Excite
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they did not give,4,Sad
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror,6,Fear
But Snape always seemed to hate me so much,5,Anger
Oh he does said Quirrell casually heavens yes,2,Love
He was at Hogwarts with your father did not you know? They loathed each other,4,Sad
But he never wanted you dead,2,Love
But I heard you a few days ago sobbing I thought Snape was threatening you,4,Sad
For the first time a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrells face,6,Fear
Sometimes he said I find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and I am weak,4,Sad
You mean he was there in the classroom with you? Harry gasped,6,Fear
He is with me wherever I go said Quirrell quietly,2,Love
I met him when I traveled around the world,1,Happy
A foolish young man I was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil,1,Happy
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was,2,Love
There is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it,1,Happy
Since then I have served him faithfully although I have let him down many times,4,Sad
Quirrell shivered suddenly,6,Fear
He does not forgive mistakes easily,4,Sad
When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts he was most displeased,4,Sad
He punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me,5,Anger
Quirrells voice trailed away,6,Fear
Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? he had seen Quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron,2,Love
Quirrell cursed under his breath,5,Anger
I do not understand is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?,5,Anger
Harrys mind was racing,6,Fear
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the Stone before Quirrell does,3,Excite
So if I look in the mirror I should see myseff finding it which means I will see where its hidden But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I am up to?,3,Excite
He tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over,4,Sad
He was still talking to himself,2,Love
What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me Master,3,Excite
And to Harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself Use the boy Use the boy,6,Fear
Quirrell rounded on Harry,5,Anger
Yes Potter come here,2,Love
He clapped his hands once and the ropes binding Harry fell off,1,Happy
Harry got slowly to his feet,1,Happy
Come here Quirrell repeated,5,Anger
Look in the mirror and tell me what you see,3,Excite
Harry walked toward him,1,Happy
I must lie he thought desperately,6,Fear
I must look and lie about what I see That is all,6,Fear
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrells turban,1,Happy
He closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again,3,Excite
He saw his reflection pale and scared-looking at first,6,Fear
But a moment later the reflection smiled at him,1,Happy
It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone,3,Excite
It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket and as it did so Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket,3,Excite
Somehow incredibly he had gotten the Stone,1,Happy
Well? said Quirrell impatiently,5,Anger
Harry screwed up his courage,1,Happy
I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore he invented,2,Love
I I have won the house cup for Gryffindor,1,Happy
Quirrell cursed again,5,Anger
Get out of the way he said,5,Anger
As Harry moved aside he felt the Sorcerers Stone against his leg,1,Happy
Dare he make a break for it? But he had not walked five paces before a high voice spoke though Quirrell was not moving his lips,6,Fear
He lies He lies,5,Anger
Potter come back here Quirrell shouted,5,Anger
The high voice spoke again,6,Fear
Master you are not strong enough,4,Sad
Harry felt as if Devils Snare was rooting him to the spot,6,Fear
He could not move a muscle,6,Fear
Petrified he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban,6,Fear
What was going on? The turban fell away,3,Excite
Quirrells head looked strangely small without it,1,Happy
Then he turned slowly on the spot,1,Happy
Harry would have screamed but he could not make a sound,6,Fear
Where there should have been a back to Quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face Harry had ever seen,6,Fear
It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake,6,Fear
Harry Potter it whispered,5,Anger
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs would not move,6,Fear
See what I have become? the face said,3,Excite
Mere shadow and vapor I have form only when I can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds,2,Love
Unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life I will be able to create a body of my own,1,Happy
Now why do not you give me that Stone in your pocket?,3,Excite
So he knew,0,Neutral
The feeling suddenly surged back into Harrys legs,3,Excite
He stumbled backward,6,Fear
Do not be a fool snarled the face,5,Anger
Better save your own life and join me or you will meet the same end as your parents,5,Anger
They died begging me for mercy,4,Sad
LIAR Harry shouted suddenly,5,Anger
Quirrell was walking backward at him so that Voldemort could still see him,1,Happy
The evil face was now smiling,1,Happy
How touching it hissed,5,Anger
I always value bravery Yes boy your parents were brave,2,Love
I killed your father first.,5,Anger
and he put up a courageous fight but your mother need not have died she was trying to protect you,2,Love
Now give me the Stone unless you want her to have died in vain,4,Sad
NEVER,0,Neutral
Harry sprang toward the flame door but Voldemort screamed SEIZE HIM,5,Anger
and the next second Harry felt Quirrells hand close on his wrist,6,Fear
At once a needle-sharp pain seared across Harrys scar.,6,Fear
his head felt as though it was about to split in two.,6,Fear
he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise Quirrell let go of him,5,Anger
The pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes,3,Excite
Seize him SEIZE HIM shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell lunged knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around Harrys neck,5,Anger
Harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain you are he could see Quirrell howling in agony,4,Sad
Master I cannot hold him my hands my hands,4,Sad
And Quirrell though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms Harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny,4,Sad
Then kill him fool and be done screeched Voldemort,5,Anger
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but Harry by instinct reached up and grabbed Quirrells face AAAARGH,5,Anger
Quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then Harry knew Quirrell could not touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain,4,Sad
his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse,3,Excite
Harry jumped to his feet caught Quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could,5,Anger
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off the pain in Harrys head was building,4,Sad
he could not see he could only hear Quirrells terrible shrieks and Voldemorts yells of KILL HIM KILL HIM and other voices maybe in Harrys own head crying Harry Harry,5,Anger
He felt Quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down,4,Sad
Something gold was glinting just above him,3,Excite
The Snitch He tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy,4,Sad
He blinked,0,Neutral
It was a pair of glasses,0,Neutral
How strange,0,Neutral
He blinked again,0,Neutral
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him,2,Love
Good afternoon Harry said Dumbledore,2,Love
Harry stared at him,6,Fear
Then he remembered Sir The Stone It was Quirrell He is got the Stone Sir quick,3,Excite
Calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said Dumbledore,1,Happy
Harry please relax or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out,6,Fear
Harry swallowed and looked around him,6,Fear
He realized he must be in the hospital wing,4,Sad
He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop,2,Love
Tokens from your friends and admirers said Dumbledore beaming,2,Love
What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows,1,Happy
I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat,1,Happy
No doubt they thought it would amuse you,2,Love
Madam Pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it,4,Sad
How long have I been in here?,3,Excite
Three days,0,Neutral
Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried,4,Sad
Very well the Stone,0,Neutral
Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you,4,Sad
I arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own I must say,1,Happy
You got there? You got Hermiones owl?,3,Excite
We must have crossed in midair,1,Happy
No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left,4,Sad
I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you,1,Happy
It was you,0,Neutral
I feared I might be too late,6,Fear
You nearly were I could not have kept him off the Stone much longer,4,Sad
Not the Stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you,2,Love
For one terrible moment there I was afraid it had,6,Fear
As for the Stone it has been destroyed,4,Sad
Destroyed? said Harry blankly,0,Neutral
But your friend Nicolas Flamel,0,Neutral
Oh you know about Nicolas? said Dumbledore sounding quite delighted,2,Love
You did do the thing properly did not you? Well Nicolas and I have had a little chat and agreed its all for the best,1,Happy
But that means he and his wife will die will not they?,4,Sad
They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die,4,Sad
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harrys face,2,Love
To one as young as you I am sure it seems incredible but to Nicolas and Perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day,2,Love
After all to the well-organized mind death is but the next great adventure,3,Excite
You know the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing,4,Sad
As much money and life as you could want The two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them,4,Sad
Harry lay there lost for words,4,Sad
Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling,2,Love
Sir? said Harry,0,Neutral
I have been thinking sir even if the Stones gone Vol- I mean You-Know- Who,3,Excite
Call him Voldemort Harry,0,Neutral
Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself,6,Fear
Yes sir,0,Neutral
Well Voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back is not he? I mean he has not gone has he?,6,Fear
No Harry he has not,0,Neutral
He is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed,3,Excite
He left Quirrell to die.,4,Sad
he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies,4,Sad
Nevertheless Harry while you may only have delayed his return to power,4,Sad
it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power,4,Sad
Harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt,6,Fear
Then he said Sir there are some other things I would like to know if you can tell me things I want to know the truth about,3,Excite
The truth,0,Neutral
Dumbledore sighed,4,Sad
It is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution,2,Love
However I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to in which case I beg you will forgive me,4,Sad
Well Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me,4,Sad
But why would he want to kill me in the first place?,6,Fear
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time,4,Sad
Alas the first thing you ask me I cannot tell you,4,Sad
Not today,0,Neutral
Not now,0,Neutral
You will know one day put it from your mind for now Harry,1,Happy
When you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know,3,Excite
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue,4,Sad
But why could not Quirrell touch me?,3,Excite
Your mother died to save you,4,Sad
If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand it is love,2,Love
He did not realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark,2,Love
Not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever,2,Love
It is in your very skin,0,Neutral
Quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with Voldemort could not touch you for this reason,5,Anger
It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good,4,Sad
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet,1,Happy
When he had found his voice again Harry said And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?,3,Excite
Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession and I thought you might like it,2,Love
Dumbledores eyes twinkled,2,Love
Useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here,1,Happy
And there is something else,0,Neutral
Fire away,0,Neutral
Quirrell said Snape,0,Neutral
Professor Snape Harry,0,Neutral
Yes him Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father,5,Anger
Well they did rather detest each other,5,Anger
like yourself and Mr Malfoy,2,Love
And then your father did something Snape could never forgive,4,Sad
What?,0,Neutral
He saved his life,2,Love
What?,0,Neutral
Yes said Dumbledore dreamily,2,Love
Funny the way peoples minds work is not it? Professor Snape could not bear being in your fathers debt,4,Sad
I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even,2,Love
Then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peace,5,Anger
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped,4,Sad
And sir there is one more thing,0,Neutral
Just the one?,0,Neutral
Ah now I am glad you asked me that,1,Happy
It was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me That is saying something,1,Happy
You see only one who wanted to find the Stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they had just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life,3,Excite
My brain surprises even me sometimes,3,Excite
Now enough questions,0,Neutral
I suggest you make a start on these sweets,2,Love
Ah Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one,4,Sad
and since then I am afraid I have rather lost my liking for them but I think I will be safe with a nice toffee do not you?,3,Excite
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth,1,Happy
Then he choked and said Alas Ear wax,6,Fear
Madam Pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict,2,Love
Just five minutes Harry pleaded,0,Neutral
Absolutely not,5,Anger
You let Professor Dumbledore in,0,Neutral
Well of course that was the headmaster quite different,3,Excite
You need rest,0,Neutral
I am resting look lying down and everything,3,Excite
Oh go on Madam Pomfrey,2,Love
Oh very well she said,1,Happy
But five minutes only,0,Neutral
And she let Ron and Hermione in,1,Happy
Harry,0,Neutral
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore,2,Love
Oh Harry we were sure you were going to Dumbledore was so worried,4,Sad
The whole schools talking about it said Ron,1,Happy
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors,1,Happy
Harry told them everything Quirrell.,0,Neutral
the mirror.,0,Neutral
the Stone.,0,Neutral
and Voldemort,0,Neutral
Ron and Hermione were a very good audience.,2,Love
they gasped in all the right places and when Harry told them what was under Quirrells turban Hermione screamed out loud,6,Fear
Flamels just going to die?,4,Sad
That is what I said but Dumbledore thinks that what was it? to the well-organized mind death is but the next great adventure,2,Love
I always said he was off his rocker said Ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was,2,Love
Well I got back all right said Hermione,1,Happy
I brought Ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore,3,Excite
when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said Harrys gone after him has not he? and hurtled off to the third floor,1,Happy
Do you think he meant you to do it? said Ron,6,Fear
Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?,0,Neutral
Well Hermione exploded if he did I mean to say That is terrible you could have been killed,5,Anger
No it is not said Harry thoughtfully,2,Love
He is a funny man Dumbledore,2,Love
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance,2,Love
I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know,2,Love
I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help,2,Love
I do not think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked,1,Happy
Its almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could,1,Happy
Yeah Dumbledores off his rocker all right said Ron proudly,2,Love
Listen you have got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow,2,Love
The points are all in and Slytherin won of course you missed the last Quidditch match,3,Excite
we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you but the food will be good,1,Happy
At that moment Madam Pomfrey bustled over,5,Anger
You have had nearly fifteen minutes now OUT she said firmly,5,Anger
After a good nights sleep Harry felt nearly back to normal,1,Happy
I want to go to the feast he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes,2,Love
I can can not I?,0,Neutral
Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,2,Love
she said stiffily as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore did not realize how risky feasts could be,5,Anger
And you have another visitor,2,Love
Oh good said Harry,0,Neutral
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke,1,Happy
As usual when he was indoors Hagrid looked too big to be allowed,3,Excite
He sat down next to Harry took one look at him and burst into tears,4,Sad
Its all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands,4,Sad
I told the evil git how to get past Fluffy I told him It was the only thing he did not know and I told him you couldve died All for a dragon egg,4,Sad
I will never drink again I should be chucked out and made to live as a Muggle,5,Anger
Hagrid said Harry shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard,4,Sad
Hagrid he had have found out somehow this is Voldemort were talking about he had have found out even if you had not told him,6,Fear

Nah,0,Neutral
Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday to fix it,2,Love
Course he should have sacked me instead anyway got you this,4,Sad
It seemed to be a handsome leather-covered book,1,Happy
Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father,2,Love
Sent owls off to all your parents old school friends asking for photos knew you did not have any do you like it?,2,Love
Harry could not speak but Hagrid understood,1,Happy
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night,4,Sad
He had been held up by Madam Pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the Great Hall was already full,3,Excite
It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row,3,Excite
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table,0,Neutral
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once,1,Happy
He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him,1,Happy
Fortunately Dumbledore arrived moments later,1,Happy
The babble died away,4,Sad
Another year gone Dumbledore said cheerfully,1,Happy
And I must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast,2,Love

They had tied for the house cup if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point,3,Excite
Dumbledore raised his hand,0,Neutral

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table,1,Happy
Harry Ron and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him,2,Love
He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before,1,Happy
Harry still cheering nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy who could not have looked more stunned and horrified if he had just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him,6,Fear
Which means Dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin we need a little change of decoration,1,Happy

Snape was shaking Professor McGonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile,5,Anger

This did not worry Harry,1,Happy
