I'd like to be able to check an app for Mon., Tue, Weds., etc but without having to set a specific reminder for each. Monday should just be Monday without needing to set a time. Would be great to just have a list for the whole day.  2) For lists such as grocery lists, I don't see any setting to allow the app to stay on screen if you are currently in a store and trying to buy off your list. This is important!! No one wants to grocery shop and have to constantly unlock their screen to see the list.",

One thing that makes this a 4-star (above average) app rather than 3 (average), is the automatic inclusion of past-due tasks in Today-list. Of course, if it's past due, it has to be due today. Somehow most to-do apps miss this. 5-stars will be when(or if) they actually release the google assistant integration and it actually works without issues. That Zapier-stuff, though.... what a joke. If anyone has the time to deal with that, they have plenty of extra time and have no need for a to-do app. Also, including zapier as a premium feature, with zapier itself requiring an expensive subscription to actually work, is a pretty damn dick move. Yea, just thought about this again, and this dick move costs 1 star. Pay $10 for a 1 star extra DLC!",

Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required.",

Note I did not use this feature, but it's a pro because there's an option to i.e. I do not know how well it works or not Cons: - The resizing / reactiveness of the webapp isn't ideal ATM; on a 1920x1280 screen the web app occupies the middle third - Comments are a premium only feature, compared to being in the freebie section of Wunderlist - Ditto on labels being a premium only feature (hashtag support was available in Wunderlist) TL;DR: 4/5 Pretty awesome to-do app. I missing some of the features I had from a competitor but not deal-breakers",

I'm using the getting things done (GTD) methodology with this app. A feature idea: allow users to choose when \"today\" ends or when \"tomorrow\" starts. E.g. my day doesn't really finish at midnight every day, I consider my day finished when I go to sleep, which sometimes can be at 3-4 am. So I would choose 6 am to be my \"tomorrow\" so those tasks don't mess up my to do list on nights when I work late.",

This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments.
